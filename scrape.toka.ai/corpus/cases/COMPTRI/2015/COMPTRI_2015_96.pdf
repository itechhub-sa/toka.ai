<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[1]
The Applicant is <B>THEMBOKWAKHE</B><B> </B><B>GIFT</B><B> </B><B>MLOTSHWA</B><B>
</B>of H... M. S., Shakaville Location, Stanger, South Africa,
presumably brings an application in terms of Sections 12 (2) (a) and
160 of the Companies Act 2008 (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;) for an order
that the Respondent reserve the name of STILL STAND (Refer to form
CTR 142) for his company.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[2]
The Respondent is CIPC which claims in its notice CoR 9.4 dated 21
October 2015 that the name &ldquo;STILL STAND&rdquo; conflicts with
three other names on the CIPC register and in an email dated 24
November 2015 claims that the this is infringing Section 11(2) (a)
yet argues a case under Section 11(2)(b) and (c).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[3]
However, CIPC has reserved the name INAMANDLA STILL in favour of the
Applicant as per the CoR9.4. The Applicant in turn is dissatisfied
with this state of affairs and has lodged an objection to the fact
that he would like STILL STAND to be reserved as a company name as
well.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif"><B>PROCEDURE
AND BACKGROUND:</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[4]
The date of the CIPC CoR 9.4 notice is dated 21 October 2015. The
application was properly served on the Tribunal on 23 November 2015
and on CIPC (via email) on 24 November within the three month period
as per Section 160.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[5]
The Respondent did not serve or file any notice to oppose the
Applicant&rsquo;s application but has filed an email in response to
the Applicant&rsquo;s order requested which is sufficient. The
Respondent opines in its email that in view of the confusingly
similar names on the register, the name &ldquo;STILL STAND&rdquo;
cannot be permitted registration.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[6]
The Respondent is also of the view that the aforesaid name consists
only of common word/s in daily use and that if permitted it would
amount to monopoly or exclusive protection over common expression and
that it would amount to the name &ldquo;STILL STAND&rdquo;
overlapping with the names mentioned in the CIPC notice; and that as
a result it would be contrary to Section 11(2) (a) of the Act.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[7]
The Respondent is of the view that the Applicant&rsquo;s name
approval as requested will be tantamount to monopoly and or exclusive
protection over common expression and will unequivocally be
tantamount to riding on the goodwill vested in those registered
entities. and that it would also amount to a likelihood of confusion
in the business world in that it would place members of the public
under the misapprehension that there is an association between this
entity and those entities already registered, which it claims is in
terms of Section 11 (2) (a). This is notwithstanding that it may be
thought that the name STILL STAND of the Applicant is the mother body
of all STILL STAND.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[8]
Respondent also states that if it were to approve the name it would
run out of names as approving it will further be tantamount to
exclusive protection and monopoly over common words. In view thereof,
a risk of confusion in the business world is inevitable unless of
course the Respondent adds a distinguishing feature for example XYZ
or ABC before the name STILL STAND, so that the element will
sufficiently be capable of differentiating this name from the names
already registered, within the meaning of the name register. This
seems to be the reason that CIPC has approved the name INAMANDLA
STILL.</FONT></P>

Although the Applicant has not mentioned in the founding affidavit
which section of the Act it applies in terms of, he has lodged an
objection wherein he states that he is dissatisfied with the decision
to reject the name reservation as it is in his view nowhere close to
the other names on the register and his name does not hold the same
meaning. He states that he does not see any conflicts in the name he
has chosen when compared to the other names listed in CoR 9.4.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[14]
The Applicant is requesting the Tribunal to make an order that the
name STILL STAND be reserved as its company name which CIPC has
refused to do. Presumably this is in terms of Section 160 read with
Section 12 (2) (a) of the Act.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[15]
The Respondent submits that the Applicant&rsquo;s company name
overlaps with the other names on the CoR 9.4 notice and via its email
dated 24 November 2015 alleges infringement of the provisions of
Section 11(2) (a); and that the Applicant should change its name as
stated above by adding a distinguishable element to the name as a
prefix.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[16]
In addition, CIPC states that it would amount to the name &ldquo;STILL
STAND&rdquo; overlapping with the names mentioned in the CIPC notice;
and that as a result it would be contrary to Section 11(2) (a) of the
Act. However, the contents of the CIPC email substantiates a case
under Section 11(2) (b) and (c), that is, of being confusingly
similar and of a misapprehension by the public into believing that
there is an association in the course of trade, most importantly
those entities incorporating the commonly used words STILL STAND; and
not the same as is stated in Section 11(2) (a).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">This
is in contradiction of the CoR 9.4 notice which is a notice in terms
of the Regulations which simply confirms the name reservation of
INAMANDLA STILL and rejects the name STILL STAND (without any basis
in Law), with which decision the Applicant is any event dissatisfied.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[17]
In terms of Section 12(2) CIPC must reserve each name as applied for
in the name of the Applicant unless (a) the applicant is prohibited
in terms of Section 11(2) (a) from using the name as applied for; or
(b) the name as applied for is already reserved in terms of this
section. Thus it is clear that if the name STILL STAND is not the
same (exactly the same) as the other names in the register, CIPC must
reserve the name.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[18]
On further examination of Section 12 (3) it can be seen what CIPC can
object only once it has reserved the name STILL STAND, if it has
reasonable grounds for considering that the name may be inconsistent
with the requirement of Section 11(2)(b) or (c). CIPC can thereafter
by written notice request the Applicant to serve a copy of the
application and the name reservation on any particular person or
class of persons name in the notice on the grounds that the person/s
may have an interest in the use of the name that has been reserved
for the applicant; and that any person to whom a notice is required
to be given may apply to the Tribunal for a determination and order
in terms of Section 160 (3)(b)(i)(bb).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[19]
The confusion arises in CIPC&rsquo;s email and reasoning. If one
examines Section 12(2) (a) and Regulation 9(4) (a) one can easily
note the discrepancy. CIPC has confused the issue of the word &ldquo;same&rdquo;
in Section 11(2) (a) with the words &ldquo;confusingly similar&rdquo;
in Section 11(2) (b) and the words in Section 11(2)(c). The
possibility exists that CIPC is reading Section 11 (2)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">(a)
as it was prior to the amendment of the Bill which resulted in the
final Act.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[20]
What is &ldquo;same&rdquo; in the law can be seen from the case law
set out below. This issue of &ldquo;same&rdquo; was also dealt with
in Renier A Schuld vs Companies and Intellectual Property Commission
CT002Oct2014 and see also notes on Section 12 in Henochsberg on the
Companies Act 71 of 2008.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[21]
Thus Section 11(2) (a) of the Companies Act does not apply, as it
clearly refers to names that are the same, i.e. &ldquo;&hellip;it
must be identical rather than &lsquo;similar to&rsquo;&rdquo;: see
also Century City Apartments Property Services CC and Another v
Century City Property Owners Association [2010] 2 All SA 1 (SCA);
Henochsberg on the Companies Act 71 of 2008 at 57.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[22]
Thus CIPC has no choice but to follow the reasoning and procedure in
Section 12(3) currently in the Act and therefore is obliged to
reserve the name STILL STAND as it is not the same as any of the
names on the CoR 9.4 notice.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">In
the circumstances, CIPC is obliged to reserve the name STILL STAND
and thereafter should it wish to object on the grounds mentioned in
Section 11(2) (b) and (c) as being confusingly similar to some or
other name on the register as listed in the notice, then it is at
liberty to do so in terms of Section 12 (4) and Regulation 9(3) (a).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[23]
Thus STILL STAND is clearly not the same as any of the names
mentioned in the CoR 9.4 notice. For example, the names &ldquo;STILL
STANDING BUILDING CONSTRUCTION;&rdquo; STILL STANDING CATERERS&rdquo;
(being some of the name mentioned in the notice), or parts thereof,
is not the same as &ldquo;STILL STAND&rdquo; and section 11 (2) (a)
will not apply.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif"><B>ORDER:</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans, sans-serif">[24]
The application for an order in terms of section 160 read with
Section 12 (2) (a) of the Companies Act is granted in that CIPC is
obliged to reserve the name STILL STAND in favour of the Applicant.</FONT></P>
