A well established network of independent wholesalers physically d
istributes the products of all manufacturers to the various retail outlets.  Although, as is implied by the wholesale model of distribution, the wholesalers take title of the products that they distribute, that is they purchase cigarettes from the manufact
urers and on-sell them to the retailers, the manufacturer re-enters the value chain at the retail level by assuming responsibility for the full range of retail marketing and merchandising functions, including brand building and development.  This involves 
all advertising and sponsorship activity, direct marketing initiatives, that is activities which entail a direct interface between the manufacturer and the end-consumer, and promotional activity at the point of sale, that is, promotional activity in the pr
emises of the retailer.  This latter function naturally requires close interaction between the manufacturer and the retailer. It is promotion at the POS and, in particular, the nature of the interface between the manufacturer and the retailer that is centr
al to this matter and which brings us to arguably the most particular and, for present purposes, pertinent feature of the cigarette market.}

 what Mr. Botha hoped for in the realm of above the line advertising, but it did not end the competition in the cigarette market or the contribution of promotional campaigns to that competitive battle.  It simply shifted the terrain from above the line adv

plied.  It has sought to establish \'96 not, in our estimation, very persuasively \'96 that these category management principles embody competition objectives and rules insofar as they ensure, largely through conveying \'91objectively correct\'92 information, an impro
ved \'91shopping experience\'92 for consumers. Proceeding from this rather fuzzy proposition, they then make a truly heroic conceptual leap when they appear to argue that failure to apply category management principles is equivalent to a contravention of competi
tion law.}

contravention of category management principles be regarded as evidence of anti-competitive conduct.  In particular we will examine the contention that the payment of incentives to secure additional space and a preferential position on the cigarette dispen
sing units, or, indeed, on retail shelves in general, is indeed anti-competitive. This is effectively the applicants\'92 theory of harm. In assessing this theory of harm, we will largely accept the factual averments relied upon by the applicants.  That is, we
 will accept that retailers were paid incentives in cash and kind in order to secure an allocation of space for BATSA brands on the CDU that accorded with BATSA\'92s national market share and that its rival brands were assigned the bottom left hand slots on t
he CDU and that these requirements were adhered to by the retailers.}

manage the category or organize the POS is limited; second, the exercise of that right, the manner in which the POS may be organized, is subject to limitation.  BATSA purchased the right to organize the point of sale, to manage the category, even though it
 is not clear that the various agreements ever record the right in \'91exclusive\'92 terms.  It is likely that it is not recorded as such precisely because this exclusive was limited, first, by the retailers\'92 retention of ultimate control over their shelves; sec
ond, by the requirement, certainly from the large grocers, that each supplier that purchased EPOS data would be construed a \'91partner\'92 and that this would presumably give them certain rights \'96 let us say the right to be consulted by BATSA or by the retailer
s themselves \'96 over the management of the category, consisting of the right to allocate space and position at the POS. However, this was effectively not tested because the other manufacturers, including JTI, did not buy the EPOS data and so did not meet th
e threshold conditions, }{\ul\ulc0 imposed by the retailers}{, for \'91partnership\'92 and thus participating in limiting the \'91exclusive\'92.  However, once BATSA had acquired the category management right \'96 with or without the requirement to consult its rivals \'96 the exercise o
f the right was restrained at least to the extent that it could not extend to eliminating a brand or SKU listed by the retailers from the POS and particularly the CDU itself. In other words, as we clarify below, BATSA effectively had the right to determine
 the space and positioning of its rivals brands in the CDU and their secondary displays at the POS but this was limited because it did not allow them to remove their rivals from the POS.  The purchase of the EPOS data secured for BATSA the right to organiz
e the POS which, given the failure of other manufacturers to purchase the EPOS data, was a de facto exclusive right; and the incentive payments paid against compliance with the drivers were directed at enabling BATSA to achieve as privileged a position on 
the POS as possible subject to the limitation that prevented them from removing their rival\'92s brands from the POS altogether.  So the exclusive was limited at two levels: first, the right to organize the POS was limited by the retailers retention of ultima
te control and the ability of the rivals to acquire \'91partnership\'92 status; second, the right to exclusively promote BATSA products was limited by the retailers requirement that their customers\'92 demand for variety in the available cigarette offerings be met.
 We are principally concerned with the substantive organization of the POS because it is this that goes to the question of foreclosure.}}}}

BATSA has persi
stently claimed that as long as the space allocations and, particularly, the allocation of position, approximated its agreements with the retailers and its stated preferences, it would continue marking stores compliant.  Where individual stores deviated, t
hese deviations would either have been tolerated on good cause \'96 as in the decision of Pick n Pay\'92s Cape Town Waterfront\'92s store to foreground Marlboro \'96 or it would have attempted to secure compliance through persuasion and consultation before withholding
 the incentive payments.   We believe this to be the case and the basis for our view is the evidence \'96 which we will turn to imminently \'96 which is bolstered by our conclusions regarding the countervailing power of the retailers.  Certainly we believe it ex
tremely unlikely that BATSA would have removed one of its CDU\'92s in order to punish non-compliance.  This is why, despite the fact that it retained the power to terminate the agreement governing the provision of merchandising furniture, and despite the sugg
estions that it may have utilised this power or threatened to utilise it, we do not believe this to be at all likely. BATSA paid handsomely for its limited exclusive and, to be sure, where it was faced with comprehensive non-compliance \'96 as in Pick n Pay\'92s
 Northern Gauteng region which we examine below \'96 it would have withheld its incentive payments, but our general view of the balance of power between the retailers and BATSA leads us to conclude that they are unlikely to have withheld the incentive payment
s in the face of lesser instances of non-compliance. }

distribution agreement with a chain of grocery stores \'96 that is, an agreement that provides that only BATSA products will be available in the chain\'92s cigarette category - the extent of foreclosure will simply be measured by the chain\'92s share of cigarette s

 to be case, it indicates that, regardless of whether or not its planograms had been formally endorsed by Pick n Pay, the actual extent of conformity between what BATSA desired and what was acceptable to Pick n Pay and therefore implemented was sufficientl
y close for BATSA to continue making the incentive payments.  The much debated case of the northern Gauteng region of Pick n Pay appears to demonstrate that when the CDUs ceased to reflect in any way BATSA\'92s planograms either with respect to space or posit

een allowed to ascend from the bottom left hand corner of the CDU.  In order to do this it \'96 presumably with the support of PMI - would have to have used its opportunity to make input in order to demonstrate to the retailer that the present arrangement reg
arding space and position redounds to the ultimate detriment of the retailer and its customers, precisely the case that it claims to make here.  Their arguments would have undoubtedly entailed the offer of an incentive payment, an important consideration i
n the advantage that accrues to both retailer and customer from the present arrangement.  That is to say, appeals to the \'91principles\'92 of category management are extremely unlikely to suffice in the real world. However, as noted above, we believe that a com
bination of factors would enable BATSA\'92s rivals to make some headway with respect to space and positioning without the retailer risking the withholding of BATSA\'92s entire incentive payment.}

 a diamond shaped hotspot appears. Respondents tend to fixate primarily on their own brand, but other brands will also be fixated upon, particularly those in the diamond of visual activity\'94. (At Par 6.4.4). We note that the necessity to \'91search for the sig

For example certain of the stores use BATSA-provided merchandising furniture, while others
 use their own furniture or furniture provided by other manufacturers.  The degree of store-level compliance with the agreement concluded between BATSA and the Spar franchisor varies widely. Hence some Spar stores use the cigarette kiosk as a catch-all for
 all products which, for one reason or another, they do not wish to sell from the open shelves \'96 razor blades and condoms are items commonly sold from the cigarette kiosk.  There also appears to be considerable variation regarding the use of secondary prom

The agreements gave BAT
SA the right, in exchange for the usual incentive payments, to install its CDUs and allocate space and positioning of the cigarette brands, including those of its rivals.  It appears however, that agreements concluded between the international oil companie
s and the international cigarette companies did not always square with the agreements struck at the national level.  Hence, although BATSA had concluded a national agreement with Shell along the lines indicated above, it appears that during the currency of
 this local agreement, an international agreement was concluded between Shell and JTI which entitled the latter to 30% of the cigarette shelf space at Shell branded outlets, a share that exceeded the rate of sale of JTI brands at Shell\'92s South African fore
courts, and, probably, in a great many other countries beside.  This excessive (\'91excessive\'92, that is, in relation to the rate of sale) allocation of space conflicted with the interests of local Shell franchisors, probably accounting, along with the incenti
ves offered by BATSA, for the low level of local compliance with the international agreement.  In similar fashion BATSA and Caltex concluded a local agreement containing the usual drivers and incentive payments while an agreement was simultaneously struck 
at the international level that entitled Camel to access to the \'91hot spot\'92 in the back wall units supplied by BATSA.}

 its best selling brands are clearly positioned, will ensure that BATSA brands are competitively positioned. Conversely, the grocers, who are clearly less concerned with the cigarette category than are the forecourts will not, despite the supine approach o

to list and place a new brand or even SKU on the CDU.  The applicants have sought to make something of the provision contained in many of the BATSA agreements that require the retailers in question to stock all BATSA brands and SKUs.  In truth, though, thi
s clause seems superfluous because, from most accounts, it appears that the retailers, of their own volition, insist on listing and displaying all available brands and SKUs, regardless of the manufacturer from whom they emanate. The inevitable upshot of th

It is JTI\'92s \'91nightmare scenario\'92 as articulated by Mr. Doyle, essentially the fear that because the retailer faces the prospect of
 losing all of its incentive payments in consequence of non-compliance with a single driver or in a single corner of a vast retail empire, a company with a much smaller market share would, in order to purchase the category captaincy, be compelled to replac
e all of BATSA\'92s incentive payments across the entire breadth of say Pick n Pay or Shoprite Checkers. This would necessitate the expenditure of considerable resources spread over a sales base significantly smaller than that of BATSA. From a foreclosure per
spective this nightmare scenario only looms as a serious threat in circumstances where BATSA is able to conclude an agreement at a central level that is then imposed upon a large number of retailing outlets, where the collective \'91all\'92, so to speak, is cons
iderably larger than the \'91nothing\'92 and so difficult for a smaller competitor to meet or to justify meeting. It is, in other words, an argument particularly applicable to the organised retail sector and so is convenient to raise now, although our reasons fo

 retain the category captaincy \'96 and so acquire the limited exclusive that is the private return arising from category captaincy \'96 the sheer size of BATSA\'92s market share and of its portfolio of brands will still guarantee it a major slice of the space avai

ailer could permit a change in BATSA\'92s allocation of space and position that left it without a very significant allocation of space and a position, albeit shared, in the hot spot.  To limit BATSA too severely would inevitably mean out of stocks and the del

Stuyvesant\'92s \'91bigness\'92 would dwarf all other brands.   To the extent that this \'91big brand\'92 effect is indeed an important means of brand promotion, the application of category management principles would then exacerbate the effect that we believe is, in any
 event, caused by dark market conditions, namely that of freezing market shares and acting as an absolute barrier to new entry.  Certainly by appealing to category management principles Mr. Botha could not have expected a CDU display to make his brand \'91loo
k big\'92 for the simple reason that its market share was miniscule.  BATSA was able to make a small brand like Lucky Strike \'91look big\'92 by purchasing a limited exclusive and, on the basis of manufacturer\'92s share, by sacrificing space that would have, followin
g category management principles, been allocated to one of its big brands, inevitably Stuyvesant.  We should add \'96 as already noted \'96 that Lucky Strike seemed incapable of growing its market share despite the marketing and trade investment attention that h
as been lavished on it. }}}}

 which the entire category, including BATSA\'92s rivals, benefits. For example, the provision of free merchandising furniture and the incentive payments designed to keep the CDU free of non-tobacco products certainly have a significant category promotion aspe
ct.   The conduct which is in question \'96 the limited exclusive with respect to space, position and secondary display - represents BATSA\'92s attempts to secure a private advantage from a POS into which it has invested without the ability to appropriate a priv

While the VMOs have a wide range of machines 
available, many of the machines available and installed in HORECA venues only have 5 columns and 8 facings, with the largest machines having 12 columns and 24 facings. In 2001 Zelezniak had less than 3000 machines and approximately 900 were five column mac
hines, between 400-500 eight column machines of one variety and 400 of another variety still having eight columns, and approximately 400 twelve column machines. Therefore in HORECA, unlike in the other retail channels, there is inevitably a listing issue, 
that is to say a large number, indeed the overwhelming majority, of the brands and SKUs that find their way onto the retail CDUs, do not appear in the vending machines at all.  Inevitably then this limited space is robustly contested.  However we are of th
e view that the primary contestation is over limited distributional space and this does not impute promotional significance to vending machine display.}

 not the client would be more willing to leave the venue for a few minutes rather than try a new brand, there are clearly other purchasing options available.  Given all this we may confidently conclude that the display on the vending machine does not amoun
t to a significant source of promotion for the simple reason that not many people have much reason to view it. This is bolstered by the evidence suggesting that the vending machines are generally not prominently located in the HORECA venues. Certainly in t
hose HORECA venues where there are vending machines but no complementary promotional activity \'96 and this would describe the overwhelming majority of HORECA venues \'96 it is our firm view that the vending machines play an extremely limited role, if any, in pr

this would get through to consumers.  Given the highly positive experience that it has already had of price competition, we would have expected a JTI determined to increase market share to take another stab at this.  Of course if JTI prefers to use BATSA p
ricing as an umbrella for its own pricing, the better to share in the monopoly rents that it alleges are accruing to BATSA, then it will not engage in price competition.  But then it should not expect competition law to rescue it from the form of competiti
on \'96 promotional competition at the POS \'96 that is its rival\'92s preferred terrain of competition. In other words, BATSA engages in robust POS promotional competition.  JTI finds it difficult to compete on BATSA\'92s terrain.  Its response is to come before the 
competition authority in order to prevent BATSA from competing on its chosen terrain, in the process eschewing alternative forms of competition, such as price competition.}

Note too that 
JTI\'92s premium offering, Camel, which with 13 SKUs represented just under half of all JTI SKU\'92s on offer, enjoyed, according to JTI, a 41% share of the premium category.  However JTI had hardly any presence in the popular category where it seems to have 3 b
rands and approximately 10 SKUs.  Although no-one has contended for separate markets based on the premium-popular-VFM segmentation, and nor do we do so here, it would appear that JTI\'92s problem is not so much Camel\'92s poor performance but its failure to pene
trate the popular segment of the market.  JTI has one large international brand in the popular segment, namely Winston, which has only managed to achieve a 0,4% market share in South Africa.  On this performance, on any definition of category management, W
inston commands neither space nor position.  Indeed on strict category management principles it may not even have received a listing. Interestingly we heard next to nothing about Winston in the hearings which, from JTI\'92s perspective, appeared to focus excl
usively on Camel which, as we have noted, is argued to have performed well below reasonable expectations.   However, on these figures JTI\'92s problems may stem not from Camel\'92s underperformance which has not only performed extremely well in the premium segme
nt but, on share of the total cigarette market, is in the same league as Benson and Hedges, Courtleigh, Dunhill and Craven A (4 out of BATSA\'92s 6 largest brands), and only substantially outgunned by Peter Stuyvesant with approximately 40% and Rothmans (with
 its very large Western Cape niche) at about 11%.  Rather JTI appears to suffer from too small a brand portfolio and, particularly, poor representation in the popular segment, although, we repeat, this problem, and Winston\'92s inability to get its head above
 the parapets, was barely mentioned in the hearings. (See JTI HOA paras 2.6-2.13).  At every turn it appears that JTI has under-invested in the South African market, preferring to take its chance with the competition authorities.  }}}}

 These are, of course, not acts of charity by BATSA whose massive market share ensures that what\'92s good for the category, is good for BATSA. Because they all involve considerable expenditure by BATSA, it is not at all surprising that it would attempt to ap
propriate as much private gain from these measures as possible, as with its attempts, a bluff we believe, to link the continued provision of CDUs to compliance with their trade merchandising drivers. Indeed, as previously noted, so great is BATSA\'92s interes
t in the health of the category (if not in the health of its customers), we suspect that JTI calculates that BATSA would continue with its category promoting activities even if we effectively prevented it from appropriating any private gain at all thus ens
uring the free ride that JTI seeks.  We however, think that JTI should compete for its market share, rather than have us order the elimination of critical platforms of competition.}}
