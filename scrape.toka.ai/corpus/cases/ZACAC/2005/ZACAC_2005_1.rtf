In March 2004 Norimet Ltd, the wholly owned subsidiary of Norilsk, acquired 20,03% shareholding in appellant.\~   On 11 August 2004 appellant announced that it had entered into an agreement with\~   Canadian mining company, IAMGold Corporation (\'91IAMGold\'92).\~   In terms of this agreement, appellant and IAMGold agreed to a pooling of appellant\'92s assets located outside SADC area with the assets of IAMGold.\~   In consideration for the purchase of these assets, IAMGold would issue shares to appellant resulting in appellant owning about 70% of IAMGold.\~   Appellant\'92s board of directors would be required to put this arrangement to its shareholders for approval by a simple majority\~   at a shareholders meeting on 7 December 2004.\~   Norilsk considered that the proposal would result in a significant diminution of value for shareholders as a whole.\~   It\~   conveyed its concerns about this proposal to appellant\'92s management but to no avail.\~   Accordingly, it\~   announced that it would cast votes against the transaction.}

On 16 October 2004 first respondent approached appellant\'92s board of directors with a proposal for a merger between the two companies.\~   In terms of this proposal, first respondent would acquire the entire issued share capital of appellant in exchange for the issue to appellant\'92s shareholders of new shares in first respondent.\~   Appellant\'92s board asked for further particulars but before these were forthcoming, on 18 October 2004 first respondent made a public announcement of its bid for appellant. A circular was issued on the same day.}

The offer appears to have been structured in two separate stages. In the first stage, which first respondent has called the early settlement offer, it offers to acquire up to 34,9% of the share capital in appellant.\~   First respondent will not acquire any more shares at this stage and, if more shares are\~   tendered, a pro rating mechanism will be used to scale back the shares accepted to this number.\~   The only conditions attaching to this offer are that certain resolutions are to be passed at a general meeting of first respondent.\~   The early settlement offer was open\~   for acceptance from 20 October 2004 and closed for acceptance on 26 November 2004.\~   Subsequent to this stage, the subsequent offer commences the day after the consideration is settled in respect of the early settlement offer. According to the circular this date is set, as being at the earliest, 29 November 2004 but no later than 3 December 2004.\~   The subsequent offer which is open for acceptance until 4 February 2005 is subject to a number of conditions, }{\i\b\ai\ab\rtlch \ltrch\loch

When the matter came before the Tribunal, appellant contended that the early settlement offer amounted to an acquisition of control of appellant which control would be implemented at the general meeting on 7 December 2004 and would be in contravention of section 13 A of the Competition Act.\~   The essence of the relief sought by appellant was an interdict to prevent the implementation of the early settlement offer on the grounds that the change in control had not been approved by the relevant Competition authorities.\~   The Tribunal held, that on a balance of probabilities,\~   it had not been established that the two offers formed part of a single offer to acquire control.\~   It further found that the early settlement offer alone did not amount to a change of control nor could it be said, on the basis of the evidence placed before the Tribunal, that any arrangement or undertaking between Norilsk and first respondent established the existence of joint control. For these reasons the application was dismissed.}

The application brought by appellant concerns the question as to whether the transaction is notifiable as being a large merger as defined in section 12 of the Act. If it is found to be a large merger, the Tribunal is required to approve the merger or to prohibit implementation thereof in terms of section 16(1) of the Act.\~   Assuming that the proposed transaction in this case amounts to a large merger and that the Tribunal is required to approve thereof, the question arises as to the powers of the Tribunal\~   in circumstances where a party intends to implement a large merger in contravention of the Act, particularly S 13 A thereof.\~   }

Section 13 A provides: \'91The parties to an intermediate or large merger may not implement that merger until it has been approved with or without conditions, by the Competition Commission in terms of section 14(1)(b), the Competition Tribunal in terms of section 16(2) or the Competition Appeal Court in terms of section 17.\'92}

Mr Unterhalter, who appeared together with Mr Wilson on behalf of first respondent, conceded that the only section which could conceivably be employed as a source of the Tribunal\'92s power to grant interim relief was section 27(1)(d) of the Act which provides that \'91the Competition Tribunal may make any ruling or order necessary or incidental to the performance of its functions in terms of this Act\'92.\~   According to Mr Unterhalter,\~   section 49 C of the Act expressly provides for interim relief but only in respect of an alleged prohibited practice. There is no similar provision in respect of mergers.\~   Given this specific provision, Mr Unterhalter concluded that the legislature could not be understood to have created, in addition to this specific provision, a wide ranging residual power to grant interim relief which could well render S 49C redundant.}

This conclusion\~   is not justified by the literal reading of section 27(1)(d) nor\~   does it appear to be a reasonable interpretation of the phrase \'91necessary or incidental\'92 to the powers of the Tribunal in the case of a merger.\~   For example, if a party threatens to implement a large merger in contravention of section 13 A of the Act, as Mr Fine who appeared together with Mr Maenetje on behalf of third respondent noted, it would be counter productive and cost ineffective were the Tribunal\~   to determine that a merger had taken place, prohibit such merger but then\~  \~   be unable to give\~   effect to that order because of the absence of a provision empowering it to grant interdictory relief.\~   If, in exercising its merger powers, the Tribunal found that a proposed transaction constituted a merger and the parties were intent on implementation, say before notification, it would be a legislative curiosity if the Tribunal did not have the power to grant an appropriate order to prevent a breach of the Act in circumstances where the breach was so flagrant.\~   This implication could never have been the intention of the legislature.}

there is nothing which prohibits a party which has been aggrieved by the action of another party to approach the Tribunal of the Court to move an application for an interdict.\~   Section 27(1)(c) of the Act gives the Tribunal the right to \'91adjudicate in relation to any conduct wherever in terms of\~   chap 2 or 3\'92.\~   The duty given to the Tribunal to adjudicate does not exclude the duty to grant an interdict.\~   The question is what conduct is prohibited in terms of chapter 3 as\~   contemplated in this section?\~   I am of the view that as chap 3 deals with mergers, conduct which could be prohibited in terms of chap 3 would, amongst others, be an attempt to proceed with a merger without notifying the commission in terms of s 13, when a merger falls squarely within the definition of the merger defined in s 12.\~   If that is the case, then any aggrieved party would be entitled to approach the Tribunal to move such an application.\~   In my view, the absence of a clear position in the Act so that the Tribunal can grant interdicts is not a shortcoming as the applicants contended.\'92\~   (at 1140 G-J).}

Mr Unterhalter conceded that there was an obligation\~   in terms of section 13 A(1) read with section 13 A(3) for first respondent to notify and obtain approval of its proposed merger before the merger was implemented.\~   That conclusion clearly\~   followed from the definition of large mergers in section 11 of the Act which provides that \'91for purposes of this Chapter..\'85a large merger means a merger or }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
proposed merger}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 with a value at or above the higher threshold established in terms of sub-section (1)(a)\'92 (my emphasis). First respondent\'92s argument turned on two related\~   issues, namely the time at which first respondent was so obligated to notify and that, at best for appellant, that obligation commenced after completion of the early settlement offer.\~  \~   }

Once a party proposes a large merger, it must notify the Commission of that merger in the prescribed time and form. From the definition of \'91acquiring firm\'92 and \'91target firm\'92 it appears that the notification in terms of S 13 A(1) is the \'91transaction\'92 in terms of which control will be acquired. This interpretation gives proper meaning to the pre notification procedure, a point acknowledged by the Tribunal in }{\b\ab\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Bulmer SA (Pty) Ltd and Another v Distillers Corporation SA (Pty) Ltd }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
\~  (Case 94/FN/ Nov.00) at p.17: \'91Notification is intended to be as extensive as possible; hence the breadth of the language in section 12. Once a transaction presents the essential features of a merger it is notifiable.\~   If this were not the case, there would be a danger that mergers that might have adverse effects might go undetected because the jurisdictional barriers in terms of section 12, had been set too high.\'92 }

1.Introduction.}
\par \pard\plain \s98{\*\hyphen2\hyphlead2\hyphtrail2\hyphmax0}\sb0\sa120\cf0\kerning1\hich\af0\langfe2052\dbch\af0\loch\f0\fs24\lang7177\sl480\slmult1\qj\li720\ri0\lin720\rin0\fi0{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
The board of Harmony hereby announces the terms of a proposed merger between Harmony and Gold Fields (the proposed merger), under which Harmony proposes to acquire the entire issued share capital of Gold Fields in exchange for the issue to Gold Fields shareholders of new shares in Harmony.}
\par \pard\plain \s98{\*\hyphen2\hyphlead2\hyphtrail2\hyphmax0}\sb0\sa120\cf0\kerning1\hich\af0\langfe2052\dbch\af0\loch\f0\fs24\lang7177{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Harmony has conveyed the terms of the proposed merger to the board of Gold Fields and is hopeful that the proposed merger will be recommended by the directors of Gold Fields.\~   However, in view of the proposed transaction between Gold Fields and IAMGold Corporation (the proposed IAMGold transaction), which Harmony considers to be contrary to the best interests of Gold Fields shareholders, Harmony believes that Gold Fields shareholders should be afforded the opportunity to decide on the merits of the proposed\~   merger at the earliest opportunity.\~   To this end, Harmony will shortly post to Gold Fields shareholders an offer document containing the detailed terms and conditions of the proposed merger.}
\par \pard\plain \s98{\*\hyphen2\hyphlead2\hyphtrail2\hyphmax0}\sb0\sa120\cf0\kerning1\hich\af0\langfe2052\dbch\af0\loch\f0\fs24\lang7177{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
The proposed merger is conditional, inter alia, on the proposed IAMGold transaction not proceeding and the approval of the proposed merger by Harmony shareholders.}

The proposed merger will be implemented in accordance with the rules of the Securities Regulation Panel (SRP) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).}

Harmony has designed a mechanism to allow Gold Fields shareholders to realize, within as short a time period as reasonably practicable, the benefit of the premium inherent within the proposed merger.\~   However, in order to allow all Gold Fields shareholders to benefit from this mechanism, Harmony must comply with the regulatory requirements in the United States of America (US).\~   As a result, the proposed merger is to be structured as two immediately consecutive offers, each subject to the respective conditions precedent set out in paragraph 13.}

Harmony has conveyed the terms of the proposed merger to the Board of Directors of Gold Fields and it is hopeful that the proposed merger will be recommended by the Gold Fields Board.\~   However, in view of the proposed disposal by Gold Fields of its international asset portfolio IAMGold, which Harmony considers to be contrary to the best interests of Gold Fields shareholders, Harmony believes that Gold Fields shall thus be afforded the opportunity to decide on the merits of the proposed merger at the earliest opportunity.\'92}

Whilst intention may have some evidential value in deciding whether a transaction is a merger it is by no means decisive of the issue.\~   A good many buyers of shares may have ambitions to control a firm one day and if all purchases were to be notified as mergers once they have assumed this intent, any number of people would be jamming the highways to Pretoria to notify mergers to the Commission.\~   Intent in the \'91air\'92 does not suffice.}

Whilst Gold Fields\'92 case is perhaps stronger on the mechanics of the transaction inasmuch as the offer documentation purports to facilitate a smooth passage from the early settlement offer to the final offer, we nevertheless find that the chain between the transactions is broken for several reasons and that, accordingly, control is not effected at this, the first stage.\~   Even if Harmony receives all of its acceptances at the first stage it does not follow that the second stage is inevitable. Whilst the second offer is automatic, acceptance of it is not, and many things may happen between now and then, including the possibility of movement in both share prices which might lead to arbitrage selling by holders or opportunistic squeezes for a better offer.\'92}

But this conclusion is exactly the opposite of what it claims; it has elevated form over substance.\~   The cumulative weight of the documents cited is a crystal clear indication of the value of the transaction \'96 to effect a merger.\~   This is not about day dreams to control a company, - the prospect and substance of first respondent\'92s\~  \~   is publically announced.}

Mr Unterhalter submitted that there was no dispute that the legal structure initially contemplated by first respondent for its bid was an offer which included an early settlement option\~  \~   Only on 15 October 2004 was the bid\~   restructured into two separate and discrete offers, being the early settlement offer and the subsequent offer.\~   This revised structure was adopted in order to comply with the regulatory requirements in the United States, in terms of which no offer can contain an option which would allow early settlement of some shares before all the conditions of the offer were satisfied.\~   The reason why 34,9% of the shares was set as the maximum percentage of shares that would be subject to the early settlement offer was\~   because the mandatory offer requirements of the Securities Regulation code on Takeover and Mergers (SRC) are triggered when 35% or more of the company\'92s shares are acquired.\~   }

Thus the transaction might well have been structured to comply with the regulatory requirements of the United States is one consideration.\~   That the various announcements and correspondence generated by first respondent amounted to a proposed merger is a separate issue.\~   }

I did not take Mr Unterhalter to contend to the contrary.\~   His fundamental objection to the relief sought by appellants turned on the question as to whether the acquisition by first respondent of 34,9% of the shares of appellant constituted a merger as defined in s 12 of the Act. In other words, Mr Unterhalter submitted that, even if the Tribunal had the power to grant intermediate relief claimed by appellant, this relief would be premature because it had not made out a case that the early settlement offer would result in an acquisition of control of appellant.\~   In terms of section 12(1)(a) of the Act a merger occurs when a firm\~   \'91acquires or establishes\'92 control over another.\~   According to Mr Unterhalter,\~   it is necessary for appellant to show that the transaction involved the acquisition or establishment of control of appellant. If the early settlement offer did not produce this result, then the transaction could not constitute a merger for the purpose of the Act and no relief could be obtained by appellant.}

In its written heads, appellant adopted the approach that the proposed transaction involved a single transaction to acquire 100% of the shares in appellant.\~   In support of this submission, it referred to the SENS announcement, the circular and the answering affidavit of Mr Grobicki in support of the submission that first respondent had embarked on a course of conduct, the effect of which would be to acquire up to 100% of the shares in appellant.\~   Accordingly, any attempt to distinguish between the early settlement offer and the subsequent offer was irrelevant.\~   On the evidence, first respondent\'92s contention that there were in fact two discrete transactions could not be sustained.\~   In his answering affidavit Mr Grobicki said \'91The early settlement offer and the subsequent offer are two connected transactions in Harmony\'92s overall objective to acquire control of Gold Fields\'92.\~   In the registration statement filed at the Securities Exchange Commission in Washington DC, a copy of which was annexed to the answering affidavit the following appeared:}

The purpose of US offer and the South African offer is to acquire control of Gold Fields.\~   It was the present intention of Harmony, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the US and South African offers, the further offers described below and the exercise of the irrevocable undertaking by Norilsk, to seek maximum representation on the board of directors of Gold Fields.\~   Harmony also irrevocably commenced to launch further offers in the United States and South Africa for the remainder of the Gold Fields shares\'85.. During the US offer and the South African offer, we will continue to review, on the basis of publicly available information, the business and operations of Gold Fields and\~   evaluate various business strategies and operational initiatives that we may implement in the event that we acquire control of Gold Fields and to the extent we believe them appropriate.\~   In addition, if and to the extent that we acquire control of Gold Fields, or otherwise obtain access to the books and records, management, employees and other resources of Gold Fields, we intend to conduct a detailed review of Gold Fields, business operation, assets, financial projections, budgets, strategic and business goals, legal and governance structures, properties, dividend policy, capitalization, capital structure, management and personnel and consider and determine what, if any, future actions would be desirable in light of the circumstances that then exist.\~   For example, we may, among other things, plan to make changes in Gold Fields business facility, locations, corporate structure, capital structure, boards of directors and/or management, marketing strategies or dividends policy.\~  \~   If Harmony eventually acquires the necessary voting rights then such action is desirable\~   in light of the circumstances that then exist, Harmony also\~   reserves the right to merge Gold Fields into Harmony\'92.}

Initially appellant\'92s argument was premised on the fact that the early settlement offer, if successful, would result in first respondent acquiring 34.9% interest of appellant\'92s shares, thereby\~   gaining control of appellant.\~   However, at the hearing Mr Gauntlett concentrated his argument exclusively on the effect of the early settlement offer together with the relationship between first respondent and Norilsk; that is whether joint control would be achieved by the two parties pursuant to the early settlement offer.}

There are two legal bases relied upon by appellant to support its argument concerning the effect of the early settlement offer upon the control of appellant.\~   In terms of section 12(2)(b), a person controls a firm if that person is entitled to vote a majority of the votes that may be cast in a general meeting of the firm or has the ability to control the voting of the majority of those votes, either directly or through a controlled entity of that person.\~   Secondly, section 12(2)(g) provides that \'93a person controls a firm\'85 .if that person has the ability to materially influence the policy of the firm in a manner comparable to a person who, in ordinary commercial practice, can exercise an element of control referred to in paragraph (a) to (f).\'94\~   }

It is common cause that were first respondent to acquire 34.9% of the shareholding of appellant, it together with Norilsk pursuant to the latter\'92s irrevocable undertaking, would be able to defeat IAMGold a motion in favour of the\~   transaction.\~   This transaction has been presented by appellant to its shareholders as being of critical importance to the future of appellant.\~   The rationale for this transaction is set out in a cautionary announcement of 11 August 2004 thus:}

Gold Fields has established a significant portfolio of non-SADC assets, which produced approximately 1.4 million gold equivalent ounces on an attributable basis for the financial year ended 30 June 2004.\~   As at 30 June 2003, the attributable proven and probable reserves for these assets totalled approximately 11.2 million ounces of gold and the attributable mineral resources represented approximately 26.4 million ounces of gold. Gold Fields believes that the transaction presents an opportunity to add further high quality production of approximately 0.4 million ounces per annum through the consolidation of IAMGold\'92s and Gold Fields\'92 holdings in Tarkwa and Damang and through the addition of IAMGold\'92s holdings in Sadiola and Yatela.}

If this carefully articulated approach to Chapter 3 of the Act was designed to adopt the purposive interpretation of the Act there can be no quarrel.\~   The difficulty is that section 2 of the Act which outlines the purpose of the Act sets out a number of purposes, including the promotion of the efficiency, adaptability and development of the economy, the provision to consumers of competitive prices and product choices, the promotion of employment, the advancement of the socio economic welfare for all South Africans, the expansion of opportunities for South African participation in world markets and the recognition of the role of foreign competition in the Republic.\~  \~   Were the concept of hostile mergers to trump these objectives of the Act by way of a particular interpretation of chapter 3, such an approach would jettison the principle of interpretative integrity. One objective would destroy a consideration of the balance of section 2. In any event, great care should be taken to ensure that a purposive approach to the interpretation of the Act engages with the wording of the Act and its overall architecture, rather than seeking to ignore the latter in order to promote a particular policy objective which is both contested and controversial.}

Were first respondent to exercise its voting rights in terms of shares acquired pursuant to the proposed notifiable merger, it could effect a significant restructure of appellant.\~   Were this to occur, by means of first respondent exercising its voting rights, this effectively constitutes an implementation of a\~   merger in breach of section 13 A(3).\~   The acquisition of 34,9%\~   of the shareholding of appellant would thus empower first respondent to materially influence the strategic position of appellant and scuttle a significant transaction contemplated by the directors of appellant as contained in the cautionary announcement.\~   The damage effected to appellant in the event that the merger was not approved could not probably be commercially undone.\~   In the circumstances, appellant would have no viable remedy available to it.}
