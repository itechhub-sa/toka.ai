INTRODUCTION}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
On 28 August 2000 the Competition Tribunal, acting in terms of section 59(1) of the Competition Act, 89 of 1998 ("the Act"), granted an order of interim relief to the 5th to 13th respondents against appellants, of whom the 1st to 5th appellants are pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers who have established a joint exclusive distribution agreement for their products, the 6th appellant is a company formed by these manufacturers to establish a distribution agency and the 7th appellant is the distribution agency.}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0\li0\ri0\lin0\rin0\fi720{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
In granting an order the Tribunal justified its decision thus:}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0\li1440\ri0\lin1440\rin0\fi0{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
"We find that an interim order is necessary in this case to prevent the purposes of the Act from being frustrated. The main purpose of the Act is to promote and maintain competition. The effect of the prohibited practice found in this case is to lessen competition in the distribution of pharmaceutical products. It is our view that it is reasonably necessary for us to give the interim relief order, as failure to do so will be allow (sic) the continuous frustration of the purposes of the Act. If we do not grant the interim order and the claimants subsequently get a final order the competitive process and structure for the distribution of the respondents' manufacturers products will have been so skewed in favour of DD (7th appellant in the present appeal) and the respondents, that a final order may not be able to adequately address the effects of DD's conversion on the nature of competition in the distribution market."}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
\tab Accordingly the Tribunal made the following order:}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0\li720\ri0\lin720\rin0\fi-720{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
1.   \tab The claimants' application for interim relief in terms of section 59 of the Competition Act 89 0f 1998 is granted in respect of the respondents' alleged contraventions of section 4(1)(a) of the Act.}

      }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
Respondents supply their products directly to the claimants and other wholesalers on term and conditions similar to those that apply to transactions between them and the claimants  and other }

"The statute clearly does not accord a right of appeal to the Competition Appeal Court in respect of Section 59 hearings.

Moreover, the claimant's contention that the common law and High Court treatment of interim relief supports their interpretation of the Act, is well-founded. In fact, it would appear that the legislature intended section 59 to provide a remedy similar to a simple interlocutory interdict, which at common law is not appealable, as opposed to an order that finally and definitively disposes of the matter."}

An order granted by the Tribunal in terms of section 59 does not represent a final order because it enures only for for a limited period. Furthermore where a person complains against a prohibited practice, or where the complaint is initiated by the Commissioner in terms of section 44, an inquiry which follows an investigation in terms of section 45 and which would then proceed in terms of sections of 50 or 51 will have to canvass the same issues which were examined by the Tribunal when it awarded interim relief in terms of section 59.

Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Loxton}{\ulnone\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
contended that an interim order in terms of section 59 complied with all these requirements. It was final in effect and was not susceptible of alteration by the Tribunal. Unlike an interim interdict granted in terms of the common law, a section 59 order could not be altered by the Tribunal on application by either of the parties or }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch

before the end of the six-month period prescribed in terms of section 59 or a hearing by the Tribunal which would flow from a section 44 complaint, whichever is the earlier. }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
As the section 59 order was not capable of anticipation nor was there any guarantee either that the Competition Commissioner would refer the complaint made in terms of section 44 to the Tribunal, or that the complaint would be referred on the same basis as the grounds upon which the Tribunal granted the interim order in terms of section 59 , it could not be contended that such an order effectively functioned in the same fashion as an interim order granted in terms of the common law.}

 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
test was not applicable to section 59 proceedings as in effect a section 59 order was a parallel procedure to that initiated in terms of the complaint under section 44. Accordingly the consideration of "expense and convenience" that lie at the root of this third requirement, do not apply in respect of section 59 proceedings and for this reason Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch

Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Loxton}{\ulnone\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
attempted to bolster this argument by reference to section 34 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 108 of 1996, namely that everyone has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before a court or where appropriate an independent and impartial Tribunal or forum. Thus when the empowering statute is unclear to whether a right to appeal lies to a court of law, he contended that the Constitution obliges a court which is vested with judicial scrutiny of an administrative organ to hear appeals from decisions of that organ. The determination of this question does depend upon an examination of the architecture of the Act. Once a complaint is initiated in terms of section 44, an investigation takes place pursuant to section 45 }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
et seq}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
. In terms of section 50, the Competition Commission can refer the dispute to the Tribunal or issue a notice of non referral in terms of section 50 of the Act. If a decision is taken not to refer, the  complainant can refer the matter in terms of section 51. Then a determination as to whether a prohibited practice has been established will be examined by the Tribunal. To this extent thus the hearing by  the Tribunal will dispose of the substance of the complaint which was initially canvassed in terms of section 59. For this reason it is my view that the }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
ZWENI}{\ulnone\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
test is inapplicable to the order granted under  section 59. The matter will be canvassed again by the Tribunal save in a case where the complainant does not want to take the matter further (in the event of non referrral) .For reasons which I shall set  out presently, the ambiguity, if any, should be resolved in favour of respondents. }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
In so far as the recourse to section 34 of the Constitution is concerned, appellants have already had a right to have the  dispute resolved by an independent and impartial Tribunal, the Competition Tribunal, which has been set up under the Act for the precise purpose of dealing with matters, such as the granting of orders in  terms of section 59 of the Act. The members of the Tribunal were appointed for their expertise in the field of competition law and the very purpose of the Tribunal was to ensure an impartial adjudicatory  process particularly regarding decisions of the applicable administrative body , being the Competition Commission.}

"Our conclusion that an interim relief order in terms of section 59 is not appealable, serves to avoid an outcome that would frustrate the whole purpose of providing an interim relief remedy in competition matters.

In short, the purpose of section 59 is to ensure that serious and irreparable harm to a complainant would be prevented and that the very purposes of the Act would not be frustrated by the perpetuation of a prohibited practice prior to the section 44 complaint running its legislative}

En passant, the Competition Second Amendment Bill 2000 which was before Parliament when this matter was argued provides for a right of appeal against a section 59 order (section 49C in the Bill) \'91 that has a final or irreversible effect.\'92 The explanatory memorandum cryptically states that \'91the Act does not clearly address whether an interim relief order may be appealed. The proposals clarify this point.\'92}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
In terms of section 1(2) the Act must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution and which gives effect to the purposes set out in section (2). Section (2) makes clear that the purpose of the Act is to promote and maintain competition in the Republic in order, }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
inter alia}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, to promote the efficiency, adaptability and development of the economy and to provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices. Were an act, which on clear evidence has been found to constitute a prohibited practice, be allowed to continue until a final determination takes place the very purpose of the Act itself would be undermined. Accordingly, to the extent that there may be any ambiguity in the Act, this would justify the conclusion to which I have come.}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
The question then arises to the reason for a right to appeal when the order in terms of section 59 is subject to a review; that is the reason as to why a different conclusion holds in the case of an application for a review of a section 59 order. The Constitution establishes a new regime of legality in South Africa. Consequently it is understandable that an application for a review of a decision in terms of section 59 could give rise to an appeal to this Court to suspend the section 59 order of the Tribunal. Were the Tribunal to have acted in a manner which would justify a review, that is a decision that could be questioned on any number of review grounds based on the principle of legality, it would be legally proper to consider a suspension of such an order. An order which is not congruent with our newly established principle of legality should not be allowed to stand, no matter that its purpose is to protect a clear interest recognised by the Act during an interim, defined period.}

The question therefore arises to the meaning of \'91subject to a review\'92 . Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Unterhalter}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, who argued this aspect of the case on behalf of appellants, submitted that once there was a right to a review, then it could be said that the application to suspend the operation in execution of an order in terms of section 59 was the subject of a review or appeal in terms of section 38(2)(A)(d). This cannot be correct. As Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Unterhalter}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
correctly submitted, were the Act to have denied a party a right to have such a decision reviewed, that provision in the Act would be unconstitutional. In short, all such decisions must inherently be subject to a right of review. As such Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Unterhalter's}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
reading of section 38(2)(A)(d) would amount to an unnecessary tautology. The section however makes sense when it is read to mean that }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
a}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
review has been launched ; that is a specific review proceeding against an order in terms of section 59 .This would then give rise to specific review proceedings, as opposed to a general constitutional or common law right of review. }
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult0{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
At the time that the proceedings were launched, no such application for review had been brought. After the hearing was over, appellants launched an application on 15 September 2000 to review the Tribunal's order. Accordingly appellants now argued that to the extent that the launching of review proceedings was a prerequisite to this Court being able to exercise jurisdiction in terms of section 38(2)(A)(d) to suspend the operation in execution of the decision pending review proceedings, that requirement had been satisfied}

This is a different problem from that confronting this court. In the present case the question arises to whether it is competent for this Court to grant an order suspending the operation of an order of the Tribunal. The court's jurisdiction in this regard is dependent upon whether the initial order of the Tribunal is subject to a review. When appellants came before this Court it had not launched a review. The papers were not drawn on the basis of a review; respondents were never given an opportunity to answer the case as to whether a }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
prima facie}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
case for success in an application for review had been made in that the very application for review came after the court had reserved judgment on the initial application. For this reason the decision in }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
SMITH's}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
case regarding ratification of authority which in turn relates to questions of the law of agency cannot be extended to provide authority for the submission urged by Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
Loxton}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
, namely that the time of the launching of the application for a review of the Tribunal\'92s order is irrelevant to the problem of jurisdiction.The improper basis upon which appellants initially approached this Court is clearly evident in the initial founding affidavit of Mr Randall, the financial director of second applicant. Notwithstanding that no application for review of the Tribunal's order had been launched when he made his affidavit, he sets out }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch

Only on 15 September 2000 was an affidavit deposed to by Mr Randall in which he set out the precise reasons for the relief sought, that is a review. It is so that the initial founding affidavit appeared to conflate an application toappeal and one to review without ever applying for a review of the Tribunal\'92s action taken in terms of section 59 of the Act. But the point of principle is this:\~  when a party comes to court without launching an application for a review and the case is then argued by both parties on the basis of an absence of an application for a review and judgement is then reserved on that basis, it would work substantial prejudice if the decision is then to be taken on the grounds of a later application for a review, the very merits of which could have a significant bearing upon the outcome of the decision reagrding the application to appeal the section 59 order.}

Without a proper application for review before the Court coupled with the necessary papers, it is difficult to conceive how a court can reasonably be expected to decide the matter on the basis of the very same test set out by Mr }{\ul\ulc0\rtlch \ltrch\loch
