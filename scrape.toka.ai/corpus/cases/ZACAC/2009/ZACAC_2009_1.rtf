[1] Introduction}
\par \pard\plain \s17\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\loch\f3
The first and second complainants filed a complaint with the Competition Commission against the first appellant (\'91Mittal\'92) of a contravention of ss 8(a) and 8(d)(i) of the Competition Act 89 of 1998 in terms of s 49B. The Commission issued a notice of non-referral in terms of s 50(2)(b) and the complainants thereafter referred the complaints to the Competition Tribunal in terms of s 51(1). The Tribunal found on 27 March 2007 that Mittal had contravened s 8(a) and dismissed the complaint under s 8(d) (the \'91Merits Decision\'92). The issue of the remedies to be ordered was postponed.\~ \~  The Tribunal then handed down its judgment on the remedies on 6 September 2007 (the \'91Remedies Decision\'92). }

The Competition Appeal Court ordered that any appeals by Mittal and the second appellant would be consolidated and heard as a single appeal. This appeal concerns both the merits and the remedies decisions. All the appellants appealed against the orders given pursuant to both decisions. In addition, and in the alternative, the second and third appellants renewed the application for leave to introduce further evidence and other related relief. The third appellant lodged a notice of appeal on the basis that it was a person affected by the decision of the Tribunal as contemplated by s 61(1). This is clearly the position.}

The process before the Tribunal was initiated by a complaint referral by the complainants alleging contraventions by Mittal of s 8(a) and of s 8(d)(i).\~  The latter complaint was dismissed, and there is no cross-appeal against the order dismissing this complaint.\~  Hence only the complaint under s 8(a) is relevant to this appeal. No question arises of whether the conduct\~  in issue could have fallen under any of the prohibitions in other sections of the Act (eg ss 8(c), 8(d)(iii) or 9).\~  The embodiment of these other sections in the Act, however, have a bearing on the interpretation of s 8(a), and on the remedies for contravention of s 8(a).}

The complaint referred to the Tribunal sought an order declaring that the practice of Mittal of employing import parity pricing (\'91IPP\'92) in the South African flat steel market constituted an abuse of dominance in terms of s 8(a), ie constituted the charging of an excessive price, and for consequential relief based on that declaration.\~  In amended form, the consequential relief claimed included orders prohibiting the imposition of use or resale conditions on customers, requiring Mittal to waive any existing conditions of that kind, the publishing of Mittal\'92s list prices, and an administrative penalty. The Tribunal declined to grant an order declaring that Mittal\'92s practice of employing IPP in the domestic flat steel market constituted an abuse of dominance.\~  The Tribunal instead made an order (paragraph 1 of the Remedies Decision) declaring that Mittal\'92s practice of reducing the supply of flat steel products available for sale on the domestic market through the imposition of conditions of resale on the steel merchants and those of its customers who receive a rebate off the Mittal SA domestic list price is an abuse of dominance in terms of s 8(a).}

Since the only conduct proscribed by s 8(a) is the charging of an excessive price, the Tribunal\'92s declaratory order can be characterised as a declaration that Mittal\'92s practice of reducing the supply of flat steel in South Africa through the imposition of resale conditions constitutes the charging of an excessive price. The remaining orders made by the Tribunal were consequential upon its declaratory order. The Tribunal would have had no jurisdiction to grant the consequential relief in the absence of a finding that Mittal had charged an excessive price in violation of s 8(a).}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn2" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

\par \pard\plain \s17\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult1\qj{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\loch\f3
Although the Tribunal\'92s declaratory order refers to the imposition of resale conditions on \'91the steel merchants\'92, the Tribunal appears to have had only one arrangement in mind, namely the condition in the agreement between Mittal and the Macsteel joint venture company (the second appellant) in terms whereof the latter handles Mittal\'92s exports on the basis that the steel in question must be exported and cannot be resold by the second appellant into the domestic market.\~  Mittal exports steel exclusively through the joint venture company.\~  Sales from Mittal to the second respondent and by the latter to the end-customer are back-to-back contracts. The reference to customers who receive rebates is a reference to customers to whom such rebates are offered because they either intend to use the steel in the manufacture of steel products for export or because they are competing domestically with cheap imports of fabricated steel products. The price at which Mittal exports steel through the second appellant has historically been lower than the domestic price.\~  In respect of the period covered by the evidence, Mittal\'92s domestic price was determined with reference to IPP, though various customers were offered discounts and rebates.\~  }

The Tribunal ruled that s 8(a) did not require an analysis of price levels. Nevertheless, it appears to have been of the view that the domestic price was higher than it would have been if resale conditions had not been imposed on the second respondent and on rebate customers.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn3" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

The Tribunal\'92s thinking was that if customers who received reduced prices were free simply to resell the steel into the domestic market, such steel would become available domestically at lower prices than IPP, thus causing the domestic price to drop from IPP and tend towards the export price. The Tribunal described the imposition of the resale conditions as a segmentation of the market which led to a reduction in the volume of steel available domestically.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn4" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

It is common cause that Mittal manufactures more steel than is required by the domestic market.\~  Mittal supplies part of its production to the international steel market. Mittal found it more efficient to use the services of the second appellant as its vehicle for marketing steel in the international steel market.

The allocation between products for the domestic market and products for the international market, lies entirely with Mittal.

Given the differences in specification between products produced by Mittal, the orders (both domestic and international) are placed early which enables Mittal to estimate and meet the local demand and still produce for orders generated internationally.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn10" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

As will be elaborated at length, in this case Mittal SA does rely on its super-dominant structural position as well as on ancillary conduct in setting the price that it charges. Only if both forms of these remedies are impossible to devise should an actual price level be specified. In short, we treat excessive pricing as a phenomenon that may arise from a particular structure and that itself may be the basis for ancillary conduct that is utilized in order to sustain supra-competitive prices, to sustain, as per the definition of the Act \'85\'92 (own italics).}

The Tribunal accepted that Mittal produces more steel than the domestic market requires and, consequently exports the excess production. The second appellant is the \'91export arm\'92 of Mittal and Mittal offers the excess production to the second appellant at a discount or rebate on the price it charges domestic steel merchants. In return, the second appellant undertakes not to sell the excess in the domestic market. Therefore, the Tribunal opined that Mittal shorts the domestic market by ensuring that the excess production is not available in South Africa at a lower price than its own domestic price. In this way, the Tribunal found, Mittal maintains its domestic price at a higher level than would have been the case if the excess were also made available to merchants at a lower price in the domestic market.

 This is a market structure that is rarely encountered in competition analysis, possibly as rare as its opposite number, a market that meets the conditions of perfect competition. As already noted, while even a super-dominant firm, a monopolist pure and simple, remains constrained by the existence of a ceiling in the price that it may charge, this limitation is not imposed by, indeed is in no way influenced by, the pricing practices of competitors, actual or potential, in the relevant market, or, even as a last resort, by the ability of the customers, to forego use of the product in question.}

The Tribunal held further that to achieve this price Mittal was obliged to engage in further acts that amounted to an abuse of its dominance, namely withholding its full supply from the domestic market. Absent this further conduct, particularly the JV, Mittal would not be able to charge the maximum monopoly price because, for example, Macsteel would then accept an offer to sell to a domestic purchaser at a price below Mittal\'92s domestic price but above the price Macsteel could realise on the international market.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn28" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

In other words, our finding of excessive pricing does not derive from an examination of the market structure alone; it also rests on the ancillary conduct upon which Mittal SA relied, ancillary conduct that itself depends upon the existence of structural super-dominance, in order to achieve its pricing ambitions. It is the cumulative impact of this structure and the ancillary conduct that puts Mittal SA\'92s contravention of Section 8(a) beyond doubt.\'92}

This analysis of the reasoning employed by the Tribunal assists in elucidating the core basis of the dispute in this case: the definition of excessive pricing appears to mandate an examination as to whether there is a reasonable relationship between the price charged and the economic value of the good or service.\~ \~  Volumes of expert evidence were generated to give content to this relationship.\~ \~  However, the Tribunal held that it was not necessary in this case to determine the reasonableness of the relationship between the maximum monopoly price charged by Mittal and the economic value of flat steel products on the basis of an empirical quantitative comparative study of prices in various markets.\~ \~  In its view, the price charged by Mittal could never bear a reasonable relationship to the economic value because it was the maximum monopoly price achieved through the exertion of market power to reduce supply in the domestic market and was therefore, by definition, not determined under conditions of competition (which would always have invariably produced a lower price). The Tribunal held that, in the light of this evidence, it was not necessary for it to consider the expert evidence to establish that fact: }

[153]\~  In summary then, our examination as to the source of the pricing power is thus an examination into its reasonableness. Reasonableness in the context of a competition statute must mean \'91economically reasonable\'92. Economically reasonable in the context of a competition statute must mean having regard to the pro and anti \'96competitive considerations that we normally apply. As we go on to argue in this decision, the occasions where one can find no reasonable relationship between a price and the economic value underpinning it are few indeed. The circumstances giving rise to Mittal SA\'92s pricing power in respect of some of its domestic consumers depends on the existence of a range of factual issues that we do not encounter in the market place everyday, even in those markets habituated by long extant dominant firms.}

means. The term is a defined one and hence it is the statutory, rather than the dictionary, definition of the word that we apply.

 explanation, that is, of an explanation that does not rely upon the exercise of the degree of market power that arises from super-dominance.

This paragraph did not deal with the question of how it can or should be objectively determined whether or not a particular price \'91has no reasonable relation to the economic value of the product supplied\'92 and hence be regarded as \'91excessive\'92.\~  An answer to this question appears from the following paragraphs. What the Commission argued was that, in order to assess whether a price is \'91excessive\'92, there was no need to engage in an empirical enquiry into the costs actually incurred, (and hence the comparison between those costs and the actual selling prices, and the assessment whether the difference is excessive); and that the final assessment whether a price is unfair in itself, or when compared to competing products, could be made without an empirical enquiry into costs actually incurred.\~  Put positively, the Commission contended that the assessment that a price actually charged is excessive and hence unfair, could be made purely by comparing that price with other prices. This contention of the Commission was rejected by the ECJ: the absence of an enquiry resulted in the Commission having failed to prove, by the required evidence, that the price actually charged in the member-States other than Ireland was \'91excessive\'92.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn60" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

It seems to follow that, in determining the economic value of a good or service, the cost savings to the firm resulting from the subsidised loan or the lower than market rental \'96 or indeed any other special advantage, current or historical, that serves to reduce the particular firm\'92s costs below the notional competitive norm ought to be disregarded. Thus economic value\'92 is a notional objective competitive-market standard, and not one derived from circumstances peculiar to the particular firm. If the firm\'92s price is no higher than economic value, no contravention of s 8(a) can arise. If, however, the firm\'92s price is in fact higher than economic value so determined, the test of reasonableness in respect of the difference remains to be applied. The expression \'91reasonable profit\'92}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn71" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs26\lang7177\loch\f6

when dealing with economic value should be avoided. The test of reasonableness applies to the excess of price over economic value, and thus only to the element of \'91pure profit\'92 (over and above \'91normal profit\'92) implicit in that price.\~  It is at this stage of the enquiry that\~  circumstances peculiar to the particular dominant firm would rationally come into the reckoning. It would seem sound, when considering whether the higher price bears a reasonable relation to economic value or not, to take into account the benefits flowing to the firm from the subsidised loan, long-term low rental, or other special advantage which may serve to reduce its own long-run average costs below the notional norm. Having regard to all the particular circumstances, it might then be concluded that no addition of \'91pure\'92 or \'91economic\'92 profit by means of a price higher than economic value could reasonably be justified, or that the extent of the excess which might otherwise be justified would fall to be reduced. By parity of reasoning, accounting costs may reflect an uncompetitive inefficiency. The criterion of economic value, on the other hand, recognises only the costs that would be recovered in long-run competitive equilibrium. Accordingly, it is possible that a dominant firm\'92s price may be substantially and also unreasonably higher than economic value even when the accounting profit of the firm reveals no such picture.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn72" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs26\lang7177\loch\f6

The local firm may well have appreciable market power by virtue of the }{\i\b\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang7177\loch\f3
degree}{\b\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang7177\loch\f3
 of its independence from its customers and competitors; and its exploitation of that power might result in a price judged to be \'91excessive\'92 But the mere fact that it prices up to the constraining limit, to the point at which the boundaries to its geographical market dissolve and an alternative source of supply becomes realistic for its customers, provides no basis for determining whether its price at that limit is higher than and bears a reasonable relation to economic value or not. The question is simply whether the actual price level at which imports constrain the price of domestic supplies is excessive or not when charged by the domestic supplier. Abuse arises where a domestic monopoly (or indeed an oligopoly in which firms have market power) employs the shelter of distance, for example to extract an unjustifiable amount of \'91pure profit\'92 by way of a price unreasonably higher than the economic value of the good or service concerned.

If prices charged by foreign suppliers in competitive markets provide a sound comparative basis for assessing the economic value of similar products produced here, then the extent of the transport and related costs needed to bring the foreign supplies to our market will obviously provide a measure of the price premium which a local dominant supplier could extract, over and above economic value. Knowing the extent of the transport and related costs may thus provide a basis for a finding of market power \'96 but the premise remains that a notional competitive price (or economic value) shall first have been established. Once economic value has been established, it is the actual amount of the excess in the price charged by the local firm that has to be measured and evaluated for the purposes of s 8(a). All that import parity pricing will indicate is that the firm is pricing fully to the constraining limit. A dominant supplier which is able, and does, simply set its price at import parity without careful reference to costs would do so at its peril, for, if the import parity price is higher than the economic value of the supply, the supplier could well have difficulty defending the excess as having any reasonable relation to economic value. However, if in fact the supplier references its price to prices prevailing in other comparable but competitive markets, then its price would be likely to approximate to economic value.}

The Tribunal, however, did not approach the matter in this way but, regarded the price charged by Mittal as one having no reasonable relation to the economic value of the good or service simply because of the absence of normal and effective competition.

Where input costs vary considerably in cycles, the dominant firm\'92s actual costs may fall sharply without it carrying out a corresponding reduction in its price. Likewise, if the firm usually prices to import parity, it may neglect for a time to bring its price into correspondence with that (ultimately constraining) maximum, relying in the short-term on customer ignorance or inertia in order to charge more. In consequence, the firm\'92s own accounting profits may show a considerable increase during a certain period or periods, over and above the levels which it usually achieves. If there is no reason to suppose that the firm\'92s own usual levels of accounting profit would have resulted in a return on capital that is less than the notional competitive norm (ie enough to sustain it in business in the long run), then it would appear }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang7177\loch\f3

If expert evidence has been given concerning costing data, the necessary adjustments to be made for comparative purposes, the appropriate methodology needed to establish the opportunity cost of capital and allow for depreciation and replenishment of plant etc, then findings based on an evaluation of that evidence will have to be made.

Mittal may accept or decline these offers. The second appellant undertook to purchase the entire export capacity of Mittal. Sales are made by Mittal to the second appellant on a FOB stowed basis in US dollars. Payment is made to Mittal on average 13 days after invoice whether or not payment has been received by the second appellant. Only Mittal\'92s excess production is exported in this way. Price states: \'91The export allocations vary according to domestic requirements, production capacity of the mills, and maintenance programmes. Domestic market requirements always take precedence over exports.\'92}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn108" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

It follows that the second appellant has no control over Mittal\'92s allocation of products for export, its costs or domestic pricing policy or international steel prices. It follows that export prices will be lower than domestic prices since the \'91price paid to the producer at the point of shipment from the producer\'92s country must be reduced by all the costs of transporting the material to the overseas market concerned ...\'92.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#_ftn109" }{\fldrslt \cf2\ul\ulc0\langfe255\lang255\lang255\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\loch\f5

they actively sought to disabuse both respondents from this notion. Granted, the complainants are correct that relief in competition cases is complex, and that sometimes a remedy that may seem obvious in the dying moments of a case, may not have been obvious at its birth; but in this case the complainants have not convinced us that it took subsequent reflection at the end of the litigious jousting, for an epiphany to come to them for the first time that the joint venture needed to face remedial action.

indeed the express disavowal in the pleadings coupled with the late reassurance by counsel seems to reinforce this; that tactically it would be better not to attack the joint venture as this would leave them with one opponent rather than two.

In view of this chronology and the manner in which the forms of relief were couched, it seems that the second appellant is justified in its contention and belief that on a proper construction of the amended prayers for relief, as formulated, none of them could, even if granted, affect the second appellant\'92s rights and interests under the JV Agreement.\~  The declaratory order sought in prayer A would determine the ambit of any conduct which may be found to be prohibited conduct; all the other orders sought would only constitute mandatory or prohibitory interdicts to give effect to such declaratory order.\~  The declaratory order sought in prayer A, however, was limited to the pricing practice of Mittal \'91in the South African flat steel market\'92.\~  The JV Agreement, however, show that the second appellant did not trade in, or have anything to do with Mittal\'92s pricing policies, or any pricing of flat steel, or any steel, in the South African market.\~  Under the JV Agreement the second appellant brought to Mittal offers, which Mittal could, if it so chose, accept in order to dispose of its export volumes.\~  Hence, prayer C (bis), like prayer A (and prayers B and D) was not construed as applying to the trading activities of the second appellant pursuant to the JV Agreement.\~  More specifically, the \'91customer\'92 referred to in prayers C (bis) 3(i) and C (bis) 3(ii) and C (bis) 4, was not seen as applying to the second appellant, who, acting for a fixed margin as export arm of Mittal, arranged sales of Mittal\'92s export volumes in the international steel market with ultimate purchasers with whom volumes, prices and destinations had been agreed.\~  On the contrary, the word \'91customer\'92 in prayers C (bis) 3(i) and (ii), and C (bis) 4, it was submitted, could only be reasonably construed as applying to a \'91customer\'92 who may wish to resell the Mittal products in the domestic market \'96 a possibility for which the very nature and scope of the JV Agreement left no room. Moreover, since the Competition Tribunal had refused the application to introduce prayers C (bis) 1 and 2, it would reasonably follow that the second appellant remained unconstrained to continue its exports under the JV Agreement, the essence whereof was for the second appellant to obtain the best international prices for Mittal\'92s surplus production, and bring them to Mittal for acceptance or rejection.\~  These prayers were reproduced in orders 2(i), 2(ii) and 3 of the Tribunal\'92s final order:}

The prayer for a declaratory order, which would define the scope and limits of the prohibited conduct, was originally that Mittal\'92s practice of employing import parity pricing in the South African flat steel market, be declared an abuse of dominance.\~  The complainants sought to amend the nature and scope of the prohibited conduct by seeking, in the alternative, an order prohibiting Mittal, directly or through an entity in which it has an interest (ie the second appellant) from exporting flat steel products from South Africa at all. The application for this amendment was refused.\~  The declaratory order as originally prayed for, remained unchanged.

It would be unfair to deny the complainant any form of declaratory relief because we have formulated the theory of harm in a different form.

Order 1 differs from the declarator sought by the complainants ( an order that the practice of employing import parity pricing in the South African flat steel market a prohibited practice). Despite the limits inherent in order 1, orders 2(i), 2(ii) and 3 are formulated so as to apply to any \'91customer\'92 of Mittal for flat steel products, regardless of whether it is a customer supplied with products \'91available for sale in the domestic market\'92; and even where there is no \'91imposition\'92 of conditions of resale on the customer (see order 2(ii)); and regardless of whether the customer receives \'91a rebate off the Mittal SA domestic list price\'92. If orders 1, 2 and 3 are to be read literally they could well be applicable to the second appellant. The second appellant submitted that had they had notice or forewarning of the substance and formulation of order 1, it would have presented evidence and argument to show that order 1, and the consequential orders 2, 3 and 4, should not be made in terms which affected the rights and interests of the second appellant under the JV Agreement.\~  So, for instance, the second appellant would have presented its own evidence to show that it does not deal in products \'91available for sale on the domestic market\'92; nor does it \'91receive a rebate off the Mittal SA domestic list price\'92; nor are conditions of resale \'91imposed\'92 on it; nor does the JV Agreement have anything to do with preserving the possibilities of arbitrage. Hence, also in respect of order 1, there was no compliance with Rule 18(2) and in any event the second appellant was taken by surprise by order 1 (which is the foundation for the other orders), and consequently the hearing was not conducted in accordance with the principles of natural justice as required by s 52(2)(a) of the Act.}

If one thinks away for the moment the existence of MJV as the intermediary in export sales and postulates the ultimate export customer as purchasing directly from Mittal FOB in South Africa, an export customer is in essence one who represents the Mittal that he will buy a particular volume of steel from Mittal but is prepared to pay no more than (say) $470 pt FOB in Durban, because if the price were higher he could get the product cheaper domestically or from an exporter is (say) Brazil or China.\~ \~  Mittal justifiably regards the price as very low, and unsustainable if applied to its business as a whole.\~ \~  However, because the price will cover variable cost and make some contribution to fixed cost, it makes business sense to do the deal.\~ \~  Given the basis of the transaction, it is perfectly legitimate for Mittal to hold the customer to its representation by way of a condition against domestic resale.\~ \~  Such a condition merely prevents the customer from representing that he is a customer in the export market when in truth he is a customer in the domestic market.\~ \~  MJV as an intermediary simply takes place of this national export customer, and is thus subject to the condition.\'92}

In Mr Unterhalter\'92s view, export prices are a reliable indicator of the sort of prices that would be achieved by Mittal for flat steel products in conditions of competition in the domestic market, and therefore the economic value of flat steel.\~ \~  Having regard to the massive differences between those export prices and the domestic prices charged by Mittal, the respondents contended that Mittal\'92s domestic IPP-based prices bore no reasonable relation to the economic value of flat steel and were therefore excessive.}

Industry-wide adherence to a single basing-point price system also may result in some firms acting in a manner that would be contrary to their individual interests if they acted without collusion.\~ \~  Some sellers are located closer than others to particular customers.\~ \~  When transportation cost is substantial relative to product cost, this location advantage is a significant competitive benefit that firms, acting unilaterally and in their own self interest, would seek to exploit.\~ \~  Employment of a uniform basing-point system requires sellers to sacrifice that locational advantage by charging \'93phantom freight.\'94\~ \~  On the basis of the expert testimony before it, the jury could infer that such behavior would not persist in the plywood market absent collusion \'96 i.e.,\~  that under competitive conditions, southern plywood sellers seeking to expand their sales would have reduced freight charges to nearby purchasers until the \'93phantom\'94 cost was eliminated.\~ \~  Based on respondents\'92 evidence, the jury could have concluded that adherence to an artificial basing-point system by all sellers would only be rational if those sellers who sacrificed locational advantages were assured by agreement of some recompense in the form of enchanced general price.\'92}

The use of phantom freight appears to approximate the IPP system adopted by\~  MIttal in the present case.\~ \~  It thus further illustrates the need for a proper evaluation of Mittal\'92s explanation of its IPP policy within the context of the wording of s 8(a) read together with s 1(i) (ix).\~  \~ }

\par \pard\plain \s17\sb0\sa120\sl480\slmult1\qj{\rtlch \ltrch
\'91}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
The ordinary course in such a dispute is to refer a matter such as this back to third respondent because a Court is slow to assume a discretion which has been granted by the Act to a tribunal (see }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3
Johannesburg City Council v Administrator, Transvaal & Another}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3
1969 (2) SA 72 (T) at 76). Case law supports the conclusion, however, that a reviewing court will itself correct a decision of a tribunal, notwithstanding the general approach where the result is a foregone conclusion, where further delay may cause undue prejudice, or where the Tribunal or functionary has exhibited bias or incompetence which would render it unfair to expose a party to the very same jurisdiction. This approach has been confirmed in }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3

In approving the plan in question, the first respondent was discharging its administrative functions. When setting aside such a decision, a court of law will be governed by certain principles in deciding whether to refer the matter back or substitute its own decision for that of the administrative organ. The principles governing such a decision have been set out as follows:}
\par \pard\plain \s17\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch
\'91}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3
From a survey}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
\'85 }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3
of the decisions it seems to me possible to state the basic principle as follows; namely, that the Court has a discretion to exercise judicially upon a consideration of facts of each case and that although the matter will be sent back if there is no reason for not doing so, in essence it is a question of fairness to both sides.}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch

\par \pard\plain \s17\sb0\sa120{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3
The general principle is, therefore, that the matter will be sent back unless there are special circumstances giving reason for not doing so. Thus, for example a matter would not be referred back where the tribunal or functionary has exhibited bias or gross incompetence, or when the outcome appears to be foregone.}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch

I propose to deal with the three exceptions to the general rule as set out in the }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3
Erf 167 Orchards CC}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\loch\f3
 case. In my view, the result in this dispute is not a foregone conclusion. Questions arise as to the power of third respondent, acting in terms of section 53, to admit a party to merger proceedings of this kind. In particular, reference can be made to the various objectives of the Act in terms of section 2, including that small and medium size enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the economy (52(e)); the promotion of a greater spread of ownership, in particular to increase the ownership stakes of historically disadvantaged persons (52(f)). The decision as to who should be appropriately admitted as a participant must be made with reference to the Act as a whole, including its purposes, two of which I have outlined. In the circumstances of this dispute it cannot be said that it is a foregone conclusion that either first respondent should be refused rights of intervention, or admitted as a participant.\'92}

Moreover, it is clear from the evidence that the complainant and the other witnesses who are steel users believe that their commercial activities are disadvantaged in their respective market places because of the price charged for a \'91must have\'92 input, steel. This is what has caused them to invoke Section 8(a) of the Act - they are aggrieved by the absolute price charged for steel.\~  Hence what we have been asked to pronounce upon is the inability of domestic producers to bargain over the price of Mittal SA\'92s excess supply of flat steel products. What clearly emerges is dissatisfaction \'96 and a degree of puzzlement \'96 at the notion that domestic steel prices are based on market conditions in distant markets rather than on supply and demand conditions in the South African market and that notional transport charges are levied on a product that is not, in physical reality, transported over the vast and costly distances that nevertheless constitute an important element of the domestic price.\~  The complainants clearly believe ... that the price of steel should be determined by local demand and supply conditions which, in their estimation \'96 and they are correct \'96 would, if free of abusive conduct, produce a lower steel price. Hence the allegation has been one of excessive pricing.\'92 }

}} Merits Decision para 2. In para 133 the Tribunal noted that the second enquiry was mandated because s 8(a) is ultimately directed at conduct and so: \'91were we to derive our conclusions regarding the alleged existence of excessive pricing solely by reference to structure, we would effectively be concluding that certain structures \'96 uncontested firms in incontestable and unregulated markets \'96 were prohibited per se. We do not believe that this accords with the character of section 8. It is conduct that abuses a structural advantage \'96 dominance or, in section 8(a)\'92s case, \'91super-dominance\'92 \'96 that is prohibited. It is not the underlying structure that is prohibited.\'92}

}} Moreover, the idea that the market must be \'91incontestable\'92 does not convince. For example, in an oligopoly the oligopolists would be able to exercise an effective competitive constraint on each other but, as a matter of business calculation, separately choose not to do so. The market would be contestable, although not in fact contested, while excessive prices may be charged. Moreover, even in the case of a monopolist, the Tribunal\'92s idea cannot be sustained. The market may be incontestable at the high price which the monopoly actually charges, but become contestable at a still higher price (by potentially drawing in competitors). The current price may thus be judged excessive but (on the Tribunal\'92s reasoning) the still higher price could not be judged excessive.}

189: \'91 ...\~  We have ... asked whether the structure of the market admits of the possibility of excessive pricing.\~  This, as we have elaborated, requires a showing of exceptional or super-dominance.\~  We have then examined the relationship between this super-dominance, on the one hand, and Mittal SA\'92s ability to price up to its pre-selected price target, particularly given the existence of excess supply at that target price.\~  What we have found is that Mittal SA employs its super-dominance to achieve its target price by ensuring that the excess supply that exists at that price is removed from the domestic market and that it does not re-enter the domestic market again. And because Mittal SA has no domestic competition to speak of it does not have to fear new supply from a domestic source. This reduction of supply is the essence of its agreement with Macsteel International and it is further built into the manner in which it grants rebates off its list price to selected domestic customers.\~  The result is a price in excess of that which would prevail in the absence of Mittal SA\'92s super-dominance and the ancillary conduct that it enables.\'92}

8ed (1920) 1930 Reprint 617-9: \'91\'a7 4. [T]here is in each trade and in every branch of each trade, a more or less definite rate of profits on turnover which is regarded as a \'91fair\'92 or normal rate. Of course these rates are always changing in consequence of changes in methods of trade; which are generally begun by individuals who desire to do a larger trade at a lower rate of profit on turnover than has been customary, but at a larger rate of profit per annum on their capital. If however there happens to be no great change of this kind going on, the traditions of the trade that a certain rate of profit on turnover should be charged for a particular class of work are of great practical service to those in the trade. Such traditions are the outcome of much experience tending to show that, if that rate is charged, a proper allowance will be made for all the costs (supplementary [fixed] as well as prime [variable]) incurred for that particular purpose, and in addition the normal rate of profit per annum in that class of business will be afforded. \'85 This is the \'91fair\'92 rate of profit on the turnover which an honest man is expected to charge for making goods to order, when no price has been agreed on beforehand; and it is the rate which a court of law will allow, in case a dispute should arise between buyer and seller. \'a7 5. During all this inquiry we have had in view chiefly the ultimate, or long-period or true normal results of economic forces; we have considered the way in which the supply of business ability in command of capital tends in the long run to adjust itself to the demand; we have seen how it seeks constantly every business and every method of conducting every business in which it can render services that are so highly valued by persons who are able to pay good prices for the satisfaction of their wants, that those services will in the long run earn a high reward. The motive force is the competition of undertakers: each one tries every opening, forecasting probable future events, reducing them to their true relative proportions, and considering what surplus is likely to be afforded by the receipts of any undertaking over the outlay required for it. All his prospective gains enter into the profits which draw him towards the undertaking; all the investments of his capital and energies in making the appliances for future production, and in building up the \'91immaterial\'92 capital of a business connection, have to show themselves to him as likely to be profitable, before he will enter on them: the whole of the profits which he expects from them enter into the reward, which he expects in the long run for his venture. And if he is a man of normal ability (normal that is for that class of work), and is on the margin of doubt whether to make the venture or not, they may be taken as true representatives of the (marginal) normal expenses of production of the services in question. Thus the whole of the normal profits enter into true or long-period supply price. \'85 A long period of time is however needed in order to get the full operation of all these causes, so that exceptional success may be balanced against exceptional failure.\'92 Mark Blaug }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\lang7177\loch\f3

 (by David Unterhalter) 202. It is correct that the inquiry into economic value does not involve a view as to what value \'91should\'92 be. Nevertheless, a market has to be hypothesised by postulating a long-run competitive equilibrium and the cost conditions (including normal profit) that would then prevail. While the dominant firm\'92s own incurred or likely costs will no doubt form an important evidential ingredient in such an inquiry, they will not in and of themselves provide a measure for arriving at economic value unless they can be shown to correspond to the competitive norm.}

10ed (2006) 500 ff at 501-2 refer to the difficulties in employing the cost:profit approach and state: \'91Eine Kosten- und Gewinnbetrachtung zur Ermittlung der Angemessenheit von Preisen ist insb. bei ihrer Anwendung auf Mehrproduktunternehmen mit gro\'dfen Schwierigkeiten verbunden, weil die mittelbaren Kosten und die allg. Betriebskosten willk\'fcrlich aufgeteilt sein k\'f6nnen ... \'c4hnlich schwierig ist die Beurteilung bei multinationalen Konzernen, wo die angewandten konzerninternen Transferpreise nicht immer die entstandenen Kosten wiederspiegeln ... Schlie\'dflich k\'f6nnen sich Schwierigkeiten bei Preisen und Geb\'fcren, die von Monopolunternehmen gefordert werden, ergeben. Die kartellbeh\'f6rdliche Praxis stellt daher in F\'e4llen, wo eine Kosten- und Gewinnanalyse keinen Aufschluss \'fcber die Anwendung unangemessener Preise gibt, eine Preisvergleich auf Grund des sog. Vergleichmarkskonzepts an. Hiernach wird der vom Marktbeherrscher tats\'e4chlich verlangte Preis zu einem fiktiven Preis in Beziehung gesetz, der sich bei wirksamen Wettbewerb gebildet h\'e4tte.\'92 See also Evans and Padilla 102; Hirsch/Montag/S\'e4cker }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch

[2002] 4 CMLR 17 paras 159 ff. In para 159 it was said: \'91\'92[T]he fairness of a certain price may be tested by comparing this price and the economic value of the good or service provided. A price which is set at a level which bears no reasonable relation to the economic value of the service provided must be regarded as excessive in itself, since it has the effect of unfairly exploiting customers. In a market which is open to competition the normal test to be applied would be to compare the price of the dominant operator with the prices charged by competitors.\~  Due to the existence of DPAG\'92s wide-ranging monopoly, such a price comparison is not possible in the present case. Furthermore, DPAG has only recently introduced a transparent, internal cost accounting system and no reliable data exist for the period of time relevant to this case. ... An alternative benchmark must therefore be used.\'92 See also }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch

, the Court observed (para 254): \'91While appreciating the considerable and at times very great difficulties in working out production costs which may sometimes include a discretionary apportionment of indirect costs and general expenditure and which may vary significantly according to the size of the undertaking, its object, the complex nature of its set up, its territorial area of operations, whether it manufactures one or several products, the number of its subsidiaries and their relationship with each other, the production costs of the banana do not seem to present any insuperable problems.\'92 As to the problem of appropriately allocating overhead costs in cases where the same firm produces several different products using the same infrastructure, many firms nowadays in practice make detailed costing allocations themselves in order to keep a check on the profitability of different lines of business.}

}} Evans and Padilla at 103 observe: \'91Measurement issues are the least of the concerns with using profit benchmarks, though. Accounting procedures do not provide for capitalization of R&D and advertising, do not address inflation, and do not properly adjust rates of return for risk. Thus accounting profits do not reflect economic profits except under the most unrealistic assumptions. The relationship between accounting and economic rates of return hinges on the time shape of net revenues, something that varies across industries, across firms within an industry, and even across time for a given firm.\'92}

}} The Tribunal found the relevant market to be the South African steel market and the evidence led discounted the existence of an \'91international\'92 or \'91global\'92 steel market.\~  Dednam 47: 10726 believes there is a global steel market but defers to Tomlinson and Fish. The latter two leave one in little doubt. Fish said at 42 9470 \'91No, there isn\'92t a global steel market and my chart here shows clearly that there isn\'92t a global market.\'92 At 43: 9794 he was questioned: \'91Adv Loxton: What I put to you there is that there are regional markets, which affect each other. So what happens in one market will affect other markets around the world and to that extent there is a global market in the sense that they are all related. All off the events, which affect price in one area of the world, tend to affect prices in another area of the world. Mr Fish: The answer to the question, I think at the time is I held up my chart 12, which shows clearly that different parts of the world, the peak of the cycle can be 12 months different in different part of the world. Between the United States and Asia the peak of the cycle can be 12 months apart. Now you could say that that relationship, but if you are providing something like a global price, then clearly when one market is at its peak, as you can see there in 2005, that\'92s the Asian market, then the North American has almost got to the bottom of its cycle. So if you ask me whether a global price in itself is something you can work with, then clearly that can\'92t be the case, if you are comparing one part of the world where the price has hit its peak and another part of the world, which has almost reached its bottom point. So the reason why I said you don\'92t have a global market, which came out of the fact that we have a global price, that is the answer to the question; that you are comparing things, which are just not comparable at that moment in time. And that\'92s why I said that there isn\'92t a global price.\'92\~  Tomlinson said at 46: 10514-5: \'91I am not claiming that there are not regional differences between markets. What I\'92m saying is that one market is not likely to remain massively out of line with behaviour in other markets for very long.\'92}

para 16: \'91We have emphasised that our approach to the allegation of excessive pricing has not been to determine a \'91right\'92 or \'91wrong\'92 price level.\~  We accordingly cannot find that the import parity price level is an abuse of dominance, the \'91wrong\'92 or \'91excessive\'92 price level, anymore than we would declare the export parity price to be the \'91right\'92 price level. Mittal SA\'92s offence resides in the fact that it has administratively selected a price and it has adjusted the amount that it, the super dominant player, supplies to the domestic market so as to ensure that it achieves the pre-selected price.\~  It matters not whether this price is the import parity price or, as Mittal SA would have it, a price based upon a random basket of prices that prevail in other national markets.\~  What matters is that by manipulating the supply of flat steel products available on the domestic market it ensures that the price is not determined by cognisable competition considerations.\'92}
