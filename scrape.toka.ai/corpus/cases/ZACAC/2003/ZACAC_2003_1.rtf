primary target firm is a division of Kohler Packaging Limited which  is a subsidiary of Malbak Limited.  Remgro Limited, Malbak\'92s largest shareholder, holds 50,4% of the issued share capital of Malbak.  First appellant intends to locate second appellant wi

This section provides {\ltrch\dbch\hich\b\loch\b inter alia }that whenever required to consider a
 merger, the Competition Commission or Competition Tribunal must initially determine whether or not the merger is likely to substantially prevent or lessen competition.  The test is not whether a merger necessarily prevents or lessens competition but wheth

 by S 12 A(1) must be made on evidence which is available to the Tribunal.  In other words, the Tribunal cannot base its decision upon \'91speculation of a kind which cannot be  attributed to any evidential foundation placed before the Tribunal\'92. But the proh
ibition against unjustified speculation should not be confused with the need for a predictive judgment.  The section enjoins the Tribunal to forecast a likely possibility; that is, it makes  a predictive judgment, based on evidence which has been placed be
fore it. The issue of an underlying theory is important because, in coming to different predictive judgments, appellants and the amici adopted different theoretical frameworks within which  to evaluate the meaning of section 12 A.}

The idea that a monopolist may decrease prices when its 
costs are reduced depends on an assumption that the monopolist can preserve or increase profit by way of increasing the volume of sales at the lower price.  This practice might well be successful within the context of a vast continental market with a mass 
of affluent customers, but, in a less developed economy with a limited market afflicted by a monopoly oligopoly, this form of generalisation was less  likely to hold.  Furthermore, even where efficiency and cost savings were demonstrated, it did not follow
 that these benefits would be passed on to the ultimate consumers where a few producers had substantial collective market power at several inter-connected levels.}

ricing regulations such as where a vertical merger can help a regulated firm to evade cost-based, maximum price regulations by setting an artificially high transfer price on inputs sold by the upstream division to the downstream division and as a result sh

 oligopolistic in nature.  Structural conditions in the upstream market thus are such that Mondi would be able to pursue a collusive strategy with Sappi in any event should it wish.  The merger certainly does not enhance the possibilities for collusion bet
ween Sappi and Mondi.  In addition, the dangers of relying solely on structural conditions to conclude on potential conduct post transaction are well known\'92 }

The question, of which the section requires an answer, is whether the me
rger is likely, on the available evidence, to have substantial anti competitive effects.  Given the structural relationship between first appellant and Sappi, the likelihood is that, post the merger, second appellant will continue to receive priority of su
pply over other manufacturers in the downstream market. There is clear evidence, particularly provided by Mr Bouzaglou, that  manufacturers such as Framen  will  increasingly be dependent upon Sappi for supply as a result of the merger. It therefore follow
s that the possibility of having to pay higher prices to Sappi can only be offset by  seeking alternative sources for paper supplies outside of South Africa, arguably at a higher price, which increases will then, in turn, be passed on to consumers.}
