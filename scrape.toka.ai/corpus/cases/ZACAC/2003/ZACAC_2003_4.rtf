The South African citrus industry accounts for approximately 2% of the total citrus production in the world market. Approximately 65% of the citrus produced in South Africa is exported, the balance either being sold in local markets or to a local processor to be made into juice.}

In 1939 citrus co-operatives \'96 many of which had been established in the \'91twenties - belonged to the South African Citrus Exchange, a central co-operative which handled more than 81% of the fruit produced in South Africa.\~  At about this time, the government established a statutory control board which brought the single channel marketing system into being.\~  In terms of this system, all packers (co-operative and independent) had to channel the packed fruit to the co-operative Citrus Exchange, later replaced by Outspan International.\~  Prior to the repeal, in 1996, of the Marketing Act of 1968, the citrus industry had deregulated the selling of fruit on the South African market.}

the Co-operative Societies\'92 Act.\~  On 3rd\~ July 1998 the co-operative was converted into a limited liability company.\~  All former members of the co-operative became shareholders in (or \'91members\'92 of) a restructured company, Patensie Sitrus Beperk (\'91PSB\'92).\~  The company\'92s Articles of Association purported to eliminate any distinction between producers and members.\~  However a producer was a specific type of member because certain members were not producers, but only made use of the trading department which supplied farm equipment.}

In March 1999, a second company, namely Patensie Sitrus Beherend Beperk, the [Appellant] in the present matter, was incorporated. The directors of PSB became the directors of, and sole shareholders in, the respondent.\~  In September 1999 a special resolution was passed bringing the respondent\'92s Articles into line with those of PSB.\~  Members of PSB, including [Second and Third Respondents], exchanged their shares in PSB for shares in the [Appellant].\~  It appears that most of these transfers were affected in late 1999.}

Appellant submits that, in contrast with other companies, it does not operate as \'91an ordinary company or independently from its members\'92. It contends that its Articles reflect the long path that has been trodden. The Articles prescribe specific rights and obligations relating to }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057

membership; the servicing of the Appellant\'92s long-term loans; the transfer of its shares; the termination of membership, and the utilisation of its packing and marketing services.}

Under the co-operative members held pack rights (\'93}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
pakregte}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
\'94) which entitled them to an annual quota fruit which could be packed at the co-operative\'92s pack shed. The individual pack rights were determined through a complex formula based on the individual members\'92 financial contribution to redeeming the packing facilities capital liability in relation to the total available packing capacity of the pack house and not the volume of fruit actually delivered.}

 obligation of each member for the long-term debt of the co-operative. This system was carried over from the co-operative to PSB, the predecessor of the Appellant. }

\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl360\slmult1\qj{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
With the conversion from PSB to Appellant, a revised system for the calculation of the shareholders\'92 capital levies was introduced after consultation with the members. Henceforth the levies would be determined by the number of crates of fruit delivered across the Appellant\'92s weighbridge by each of the members. It appears that the size of a member\'92s shareholding in Appellant is approximately proportionate such member\'92s output. The size of a member\'92s shareholding correlates with the capacity of the resources of the pack house used by that shareholder. Accordingly, the capital levy refers to a member\'92s }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
pro rata}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
share of the capital obligation incurred by the company in investing in infrastructure and equipment. The capital levy (member\'92s }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
pro rata}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
 share of the debt) is directly proportional to the current shareholding of that member. Thus, if a member holds one }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
per cent}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
 of the issued shares in Appellant, such member is liable for one }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
per cent}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
 of the gross debt of the company.}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057
The packing cost payable by each farmer using Appellant\'92s facilities is calculated by reference to the quantity and the quality of fruit delivered by that particular member.}

Since 1928 to the present day, and even after the former co-op had changed into a company, the relationship between the entity itself (currently the Appellant) and its members has not changed: for pro-competitive, sound economic, cost-effective and efficiency reasons, a number of farmers have come together to pool their resources for the purposes of packing and marketing, thereby ultimately ensuring a higher net return to themselves\'94 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057

\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057

\'93}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057

\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057
stage to set out out a number of matters which bear upon the decision in this matter. Firstly, Appellant is no longer a co-operative. Since March 1999 Appellant is a public company. It remains, however, }
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057
possible to view the company as the vehicle through which its shareholders jointly undertake the packing and marketing of their citrus produce. So viewed, Appellant is a public company which exhibits }
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057
many of the characteristics of an agricultural co-operative.}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
}
\par \pard\plain \s21\sb0\sa120\sl360\slmult1\qj{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
Secondly, a co-operative is an enterprise linking assets, business activities, financial obligations and people in a distinctive way. Care must constantly be taken to recognise and in some cases to distinguish the dual status of people who are both its customers and the owners of the co-operative, }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
in casu}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
, the members to whom earnings will be distributed according to customer patronage. }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057
Thirdly, large agricultural co-operatives are very different from what they were a century, or even half a century ago. South African citrus farmers have seen major changes in the citrus industry and, in particular, in the packing, processing and marketing of citrus fruit. The industry has undergone important institutional changes over the past eight decades. As noted the legal form of the entity undertaking the packing and marketing of citrus fruit in the Gamtoos River Valley has changed from that of a co-operative (of which the farmers were members) to that of a limited liability company of which the farmers are now shareholders. A further important change concerns the marketing of the crop. The international marketing of agricultural produce was, until recently, the exclusive preserve of a number of statutory \'91control boards\'92 established in terms of The Marketing Act No. 59 of 1968. This statute was repealed by the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act, No. 47 of 1996. The upshot is that the packing companies and others who desire to offer fruit on the international market will market the fruit through the agency of one of the many market agents who undertake the marketing function.}

The advantages gained by farmers and producers of food forming co-operatives has long been recognised in foreign jurisdictions. The special treatment usually affords limited exemption from the reach of competition law. Wherever such special treatment has been given it is to be found in statutory enactments.

The objective of defining a market in both its product and geographic dimension is to identify those actual competitors of the undertakings involved that are capable of constraining their behaviour and of preventing them from behaving independently of an effective competitive pressure. It is from this perspective, that the market definition makes it possible, inter alia, to calculate market shares that would convey meaningful information regarding market power for the purposes of assessing dominance or for the purposes of applying Article 85.}

The relevant market contains all those substitute products and regions which provide a significant competitive constraint on the products and regions of interest . The relevant market can be defined as a collection of products such that a (hypothetical) single supplier of that collection would be able to increase price profitably. Defining the relevant market in this way ensures that all products which pose a significant competitive constraint on the parties under investigation are taken into consideration. In this section, the application of these principles in practice is discussed and the following guiding principle proposed: a relevant market is something worth monopolising. A market is worth monopolising if monopolisation permits prices to be profitably increased. This will be the case if the collection of products contained in this "market" are not subject to significant competitive constraints by products outside the market.\'94}

In regard to the actual current position, Appellant\'92s affidavits demonstrate that the establishment of pack-houses is extremely capital intensive and beyond the reach of most citrus producers in the GRV. Appellant spent R21 million on its packhouse some four years ago. Furthermore, although there are other packing facilities in the GRV and the neighbouring Sundays River Valley \'93}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
there is no, or very little flow of packing services between these areas}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
\'94. This factor is of marginal significance when the producers of in excess of 70 per cent of the citrus fruit produced in the GRV are bound to deliver their crop to Appellant. }

The real issue is whether a hypothetical monopolist engaged in the business of rendering packing and marketing services in the GRV would be in a position to raise the price associated with the rendering of those services \'93}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
a small but significant amount above competitive levels\'94}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
 (the SSNIP test). }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057
Based on quotations obtained by Appellant the additional transport cost to transport citrus from the GRV to the Sundays River Valley packhouses will be R1.90 per carton. This sum represents a percentage increase of 12.67 per cent to the cost of packaging based on the amount charged by Appellant for the services rendered to its members in the GRV. I do not agree with the Appellant which seeks to compare the additional transport costs as a percentage of the total price of the citrus products received on the international market and then argues that transport costs comprise a relatively insignificant part of those costs so that in given circumstances a citrus producer would convey his products past the nearest packing facility to one located further a field. That argument is premised upon the relevant product market being the sale of citrus fruit on the international market rather than the market for the provision of packing and arranging marketing services. It is clear that a hypothetical monopolist who renders the services that are provided by Appellant would be in a position to raise the price of those services appreciably - certainly above the five or even ten per cent commonly used by the SSNIP and other tests - without losing a significant number of its customers.}

Appellant\'92s premise is an incorrect assumption that a sale of goods must take place in order for a market to exist and a failure to recognise that there can be markets within markets. Indeed, the processing and handling chain which Appellant contends ends with the sale of the fruit on the international market would appear, }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
prima facie}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
, to involve a number of markets which can be \'93relevant markets\'94 for the enforcement of competition law . Possible markets include a market for the provision of market agency services. Appellant is itself a customer in that market. It appoints three marketing agents each year from the available market which comprises in excess of two hundred competitors. There would also appear to be a market, perhaps even, separate markets, for the transport of the citrus fruit by road, by sea and by air. In the premises, the Tribunal correctly held that the Gamtoos River Valley constitutes the geographic area of the relevant market and that the relevant market is the \'93}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057

In the heads of argument filed on behalf of Appellant , it is submitted that Professor Du Toit is correct when he says \'93}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
that the Articles of Association of the Respondent essentially constitute a voluntary agreement between farmers or producers of citrus to jointly pack and market their fruit through the Respondent as a vehicle in order to manage the packing and marketing facilities on a more economical basis.

It is necessary to record that our competition law is to be sought in the Act. The policies, reach and regulatory method applicable in South Africa are defined by the Act. The Act must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Constitution and give effect to the express purposes set out in Chapter 2. Interpretation should also be in compliance with the international law obligations of the Republic.\~  Whenever foreign law is considered in interpreting or applying the provisions of the Act it is essential to ensure that the foreign law is appropriate before adopting the foreign methodology or solutions.\~  There is no warrant in the Act for the institutions entrusted with the task of enforcing its provisions to amend or extend the policy and reach which is set out therein. That is the sole domain of the legislature. Care must be taken not to impose solutions which are not founded upon a proper interpretation of the Act. Where a }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch
lacuna}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
may be detected, it cannot simply be filled by having regard to imported solutions; no matter how attractive and suitable such solutions may appear to be. }

For present purposes I note that the Tribunal assumed (in Appellant\'92s favour) that \'93a section 8 charge cannot be sustained if the farmers -}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch
qua}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch
victims of the abuse - and [Appellant] are related in a manner described in section 4(5)\'94 of the Act. The assumption does appear to me to confuse the question of whether section 8 is intended to protect a victim or to prevent anti-competitive activities whether or not there is an identified victim. }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24
As I understand the law it is competition itself which is the victim. Indeed, that very distinction may be a decisive factor in deciding whether the concept of a \'93single economic entity\'94 or of a \'93joint venture\'94 can properly be transposed to section 8 charges without legislative intervention. We were not referred to any authority - foreign or local - for the proposition that a joint venture which is organised and operates in the manner in which Appellant is organised and operates, and which undertakes \'93prohibited practices\'94 - such as abuse of dominance - is exempt from the reach of the Act. The tribunal went on to reject the notion that Appellant and its members were, on the facts, properly regarded as a \'93single economic entity\'94. Appellant relied upon its history, its \'91not for profit\'92 character and its structure and \'93ownership\'94 to support its claim to be a single economic entity with its members. I agree with the Tribunal that Appellant\'92s history takes its claim no further. Whatever the historic position may have been it is now subject to scrutiny in terms of the Act. The farming, packing and marketing of citrus fruit has changed considerably over time. I have earlier noted some of the changes. Having chosen to incorporate, the Appellant is now to be viewed for what it is, a public company whose shares are held by farmers and their heirs.}

Here the farmer-members are independent farmers who each owns his or her farm and operates it without any participation from Appellant or from any of his co-shareholders.

They have nothing in common except their participation in Appellant.\~  While the members\'92 control over their farms as economic entities is absolute, they have no significant control over Appellant.

There can be no doubt that the restraint provisions, with or without the reinforcement by the penalty provisions in Appellant\'92s Articles of Association enable Appellant to prevent all its members from offering their produce to other packing houses indefinitely and for so long as they are members of the Respondent. Conversely, the members are deprived of the opportunity to select a competitor to pack and market their citrus fruit.\~  Furthermore by tying more than 70 per cent of the farmers to the exclusivity agreement, other potential competitors who may wish to compete in the relevant market are effectively excluded.\~  The effect of the offending Articles of Association is to hinder the maintenance of the degree of competition which exists and to hinder the growth of competition.}

Indeed, it seems to me that expert evidence in disciplines such as economics and socially related sciences will inevitably be based upon hearsay evidence.\~  Given that the expert has to rely upon reported statistics, surveys and other factors and can hardly be expected to glean every basic fact personally, the value of the expert testimony and the conclusions drawn will always be dependant upon the reliability of the raw data.\~  The sources upon which such experts rely are often themselves a product of hearsay data.\~  An obvious example being the statistical data issued by official State departments of statistics.}
