Applicant applied to the Competition Tribunal (\'93the Tribunal\'94) for an order confirming a settlement agreement concluded between itself and the Competition Commission (\'93the Commission\'94) as a consent order in terms of Section 49D of the Competition Act 89 of 1998, as amended.

The Tribunal declined to confirm the agreement as a consent order on the basis that it did not have jurisdiction to do so.\~  The Tribunal observed, however, that, had it been vested with jurisdiction, it "}{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057

There are no factual disputes on the papers, and the only question that arises for determination in the appeal and in the review is a question of law.\~  The question is whether, having regard to the terms of the Act, the Tribunal correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction to confirm the settlement agreement as a consent order in terms of section 49D of the Competition Act.}

During September 2002, the Treatment Action Campaign (\'93TAC\'94), a non governmental organisation active in the health care sector, led a group of individuals and organisations that initiated a complaint against the applicant with the Commission, alleging that it had contravened the\~  Act by excessively pricing its antiretroviral drugs\~  used to treat HIV positive persons. In terms of section 8(a) of the Act, a dominant firm is prohibited from charging an excessive price.\~  Shortly thereafter on 27 January 2003,}{\cf2\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
 }{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
the AHF complainants lodged a complaint against the applicant with the Commission.\~  The TAC and AHF complaints both related to substantially the same conduct on behalf of the applicant.\~  For this reason, it appears the AHF complainants were willing to have the Commission consolidate their complaint with that of the TAC, and have the two complaints\~  investigated together.\~  The Commission thereafter proceeded with its investigation. }

the Commission must retain its title to prosecute at the time a consent order application has been launched to avoid it facing prosecutorial impotence if the Tribunal does not sanction its bargain with the respondent.\~  It can retain this title to prosecute either (a) by having the consent application considered during the one year period or an extended period or (b) after this period, provided it has referred the complaint to the Tribunal during the period thus preserving that right.\~  The legislature intended that once a matter had been non-referred by the Commission it washed its hands of the matter and had no further right or interest in the complaint including the right to settle it by way of a consent order.\'94}

One can easily see what absurdities would result if the title to prosecute and settle were not coextensive.\~  In the first place there is the fact that the Commission is left in a position of a contracting party not a prosecuting party in approaching settlement negotiations with the respondent, which cannot be in the public interest.\~  The ability to approach a settlement negotiation with the threat of proceeding is vital to a proper bargaining process.\~  A further concern is that the only time a consent order would be likely, after the title to prosecute has lapsed, is when a respondent faces a complainant in a non-referral situation or a new complaint based on a previous complaint that was not prosecuted.\~  The respondent, anxious to constrain the complainant\'92s range of remedies, then enters into a consent order with the Commission, the effect of which is to limit the private complainant\'92s remedies to those contemplated in section 49D(4).\~  Now of course that presupposes that the Commission will allow itself to be used to those ends.\~ \~  However, the expedient motive of a respondent may not always be that transparent to the Commission, especially if it was not a complaint that it referred, and it may be persuaded that the complainant is unreasonably pursuing the respondent and that a good settlement is available to the Commission even in this case it had not sought to prosecute.\~  The legislature never contemplated placing the Commission in this sort of situation as a settler of last resort \'96 once it lost its title to prosecute the fate of the litigation is left to the private complainant and the respondent to resolve.\~  Nor as a matter of public policy is it desirable that a body charged with policing legislation be left with a residual power to settle when its primary power to prosecute is lost. }

The applicant\'92s interpretation would also be extremely unfair to the private complainant.\~  The latter is entitled to proceed with a complaint referral on the assumption that the field is now open to it and that the Commission had not entertained the possibility of entering into a consent agreement with the respondent, otherwise it would have done so before non\'96referring the complaint.\~  It might spend vast resources on prosecuting its complaint only to find that it is robbed at the post by a subsequent deal between the Commission and the respondent.\~  On our interpretation this would not arise because the settlement would have had to occur during the time that the Commission retained its prerogative to prosecute.\'94}

For this reason we find that although the settlement in this matter was concluded during the period when the Commission had retained its title to prosecute the complaint, the application for the consent order was made after this period \'96 a time when we find that the Commission no longer retains the right to prosecute and hence no right to conclude, revise or amend a consent agreement. Without the Commission retaining this power, we have no jurisdiction to make the agreement that was entered into in December 2003 into a consent order. The application accordingly fails.}

Given the considerable public interest there has been in the settlement between the Commission and the respondent we need to stress that our decision not to grant the consent order is a technical one, based on the timing of the application.\~  Were this consent application to have been made at a time when the Commission retained its title to prosecute, we would have seen no bar to granting it.\~  It would seem that the reason the December 2003 agreement was not made a consent order at the relevant time of its conclusion was that there was a difference of legal opinion between the applicant and the Commission about whether it was required to state the section of the Act it had contravened.\~  The Commission it appears has changed its view on this matter and now no longer as a matter of policy requires such an admission to be made. We are not called upon to determine whether such a policy is correct in law, but we mention this only to indicate that it may well be that technical concerns of the Commission, as opposed to tactical machinations on the part of the applicant, explain the absence of an application for a consent order at the relevant time.\'94}

The power which is granted has a time component which is expressed in the words: \'93during, on or after completion of the investigation of a complaint\'94.\~ \~  The legislature has recognised that there may be circumstances where the Commission will find itself in a position to reach agreement on an appropriate order before it has completed its investigation.\~  Indeed, if the respondent agrees to cease the alleged prohibited practice it would hardly be necessary for the Commission to embark upon or complete an inquiry.\~  It is\~  for this reason that the legislature has empowered the Commission to reach an agreement during, on or after it completes it\'92s investigation.}

In my view, the words \'93during, on or after completion of the investigation of a complaint\'94 relate only to a time in relation to the investigation.\~  They do not affect the Commission\'92s obligation to evaluate the results of an investigation which has been undertaken and to fulfill its duty to refer the complaint to the Tribunal if it determines that the respondent is engaging or has engaged in a prohibited practice.}

In my opinion, it is hardly likely that a respondent will agree to cease a practice where there is no basis for it being characterised as a prohibited practice.\~ \~  It was suggested in argument that a respondent might be prepared to cease a practice for sound business reasons even though it was convinced that the practice was not a prohibited one.\~  That may well occur.\~  However, the Act is not intended to provide for such a situation and that possibility ought not to influence the proper interpretation of the Act.}
\par \pard\plain \s17\sb0\sa120{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang2057
On the assumption that there will only be an agreement between the Commission and the respondent when the latter is engaged or was engaged in a prohibited practice, I am of the firm view that the Commission cannot ignore its duty to evaluate the practise and refer the complaint if it determines that there is or has been a prohibited practice.\~  Not to do so would amount to an abrogation by the Commission of its duty in terms of the Act to both the complainant and to the public.}

 that the complainant could still pursue its complaint is no answer.\~  The policing of prohibited practices is primarily the task of the Commission and the Tribunal.\~  It is only where the Commission decides not to make a referral or fails to issue a notice of non-referral that the complainant has the option, not obligation, to pursue the complaint.\~  Even if the complainant does take advantage of section 51(1) that }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
ex post facto}{\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
 decision does not relieve the Commission of its duty to fulfill its obligations timeously in terms of the Act.\~  The Commission is not entitled to abrogate its public duty by failing to refer a matter on the grounds that it believes that the agreement on a proposed order will be confirmed.\~  It is precisely because the Commission must refer a complaint which it determines as establishing a prohibited practice that the Commission must not only conclude the agreement envisaged in section 49D(1) before the time for referral or non-referral is reached but it must allow time for the Tribunal to adjudicate and decide whether to confirm the proposed order so that it can institute a referral should the Tribunal refuse to confirm the order. \~ Furthermore time must be allowed before the referral or non-referral date to permit any changes to be made if so sought by the Tribunal.}

As noted the date for referral or non-referral is no later than one year after the complaint was submitted.\~  That date can be extended by agreement with the complainant and if so extended, then it can be further extended by the Tribunal.\~  The practical effect of section 50(4) is to allow a complainant to stymie an agreement on a draft order where the year is nearly run.\~  It may be advisable for the Commission and the Tribunal to report this anomaly to the }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057

 with a view to having section 50(4) amended so as to permit the Commission to approach the Tribunal for an extension without a prior extension having been agreed to by the complainant.\~  If that were the situation then the Commission could apply to extend the time for referral or non-referral where there was the probability of an agreed order but insufficient time for it to be dealt with by the Tribunal in terms of the Act.}

I referred earlier to the question of who should bring the application in terms of section 49D(1) for confirmation of an agreed draft order.\~  In terms of the general principles of our law of procedure, the parties who seek the confirmation of the agreed order should jointly apply for the consent order.\~  The parties to the agreement as well as any other interested parties will need to be cited and joined.\~  The Act envisages that the Tribunal may confirm the agreement \'93without hearing any evidence\'94.\~  That does not, however, relieve the Tribunal of making an informed decision.\~  In order to do so, the Tribunal will invariably need to be informed by both the Commission and the respondent as to the appropriateness of the agreed draft order and to that end the parties to the agreement should be before the Tribunal and should motivate the application.\~  Rule 18(2) of the Competition Commission Rules, which is quoted below, provides for the Commission to refer the agreed draft order to the Tribunal.\~  In this matter the application was brought by Applicant only and the Commission was cited as a respondent.\~  The Tribunal noted, however, that the Commission was not represented at the hearing - at least when the jurisdiction issue was argued.\~  The Tribunal cannot discharge its duty without investigating the appropriateness of the order and, in my view, it requires input from the Commission as to its findings, and its reasons for agreeing that the order is appropriate.\~ \~  It would be desirable for both the respondent and the Commission to jointly bring the application.\~  That procedure may, however, be impractical both from a costs perspective and because the two parties may prefer to employ their own legal representatives and not act jointly.\~  If that is so, the Commission should be asked to file an affidavit in support of the respondent\'92s application.\~  In all cases, however, the Commission should be represented at the hearing in order to assist the Tribunal with its task.}

After a referral, the matter comes before the Tribunal for adjudication.\~  There is no reason whatsoever why after reaching agreement with the Commission and/or the complainant and/or any other interested parties - or, indeed, without such agreement, a respondent cannot present a draft order to the Tribunal and agree to it being made an order of the Tribunal.\~  Such a procedure would be }{\i\rtlch \ltrch\loch\lang2057
